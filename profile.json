An old, no longer maintained mod from the days of 1.12.2.\n  \n  Old versions of Minecraft used a system called the Ore Dictionary. Its purpose was to make the life of modders easier when adding new resources that might exist in other mods already. When used correctly, you could use resources from various mods in their recipes interchangeably. However, if you ever played a big modpack back in the days, you probably know that there were like 10 different ingots for each material because of many mods adding them.\n  \n  This often resulted in a lack of storage space because all these resources from the different mods didn't stack. Additionally, some mods didn't use the dictionary correctly for their recipes so a lot of the resources were useless.\n  \n  UniDict solved this issue by unifying the same resources from different mods so only one item for each resource was left and could be used for all recipes. So instead of having 10 different copper ingots, you will only have one which acts as the dominant universal copper ingot.\n  \n  A lot of time has passed since 1.12.2 and the Ore Dictionary is long gone. In today's modded Minecraft, there is the tag system which acts quite similar to the Ore Dictionary. Still, they also don't solve the problem of many similar resources from different mods.\n  \n  **Almost Unified** tries to solve this by working in a similar fashion as UniDict did.<br>\n  Its goal is to have one dominant resource for each configured tag and make all recipes use this dominant entry.\n  \n  ## How does that work?\n  \n  By defining a priority mod list and target tags in the config, Almost Unified tries to find a dominant item for each entry and changes the recipes depending on that.\n  \n  In modern Minecraft, recipes are usually made of JSONs and are loaded when joining a world. Each loaded recipe is read by the mod and altered depending on different properties inside the JSON.\n  \n  For all inputs, the unification process tries to use the designated tag so all items will remain useful which means Almost Unified should also work in existing worlds.<br>\n  For outputs, Almost Unified will use the dominant item.\n  \n  Since the modification happens before the recipe is loaded by the game, there are no demanding processes going on while the game is running.\n  \n  ## What features does Almost Unified have?\n  \n  The mod transforms existing recipes to have a unified resource list that players and packmakers can work with. It doesn't add its own recipes, resources, ore generation or similar content.\n  \n  Because there is a chance to have duplicate recipes when unifying, Almost Unified will take care of duplications and remove them.<br>\n  Additionally, it hides all non-dominant entries from JEI/REI automatically.\n  \n  The mod is fully reloadable. Configs are loaded every time the unification process starts which means they can be edited on the fly. To restart the process, just rejoin the world or use the `/reload` command.\n  \n  ## Can you give an example?\n  \n  Think about having two mods (modA and modB) that both add Silver Ore. Additionally, they both add Silver Ingots and respective recipes to obtain the ingot such as blasting or smelting the ore.\n  \n  If one of those recipes doesn't accept a tag as input, Almost Unify will change that. Furthermore, it will pick one of the Silver Ingots as the dominant item depending on the mod priority list inside the `unify.json` config. The dominant Silver Ingot will then be used as output for all recipes no matter the mod.\n  \n  After the unification process, you will end up with some equal recipes. Almost Unified will merge them and change their namespace so it's visible that the recipe was changed.

runic font for Minecraft.","body":"<p>This mod brings the Runelic font to Minecraft! This font is compatible with any text that allows custom styles including signs, books, name tags, and item tooltips. It can also be used with a good number of mods such as the Tips mod.</p>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>The Runelic font substitutes commonly used characters with runic symbols and designs. Runelic text can be consistently translated back into their standard counterparts if you know how characters are substituted. All upper and lower case characters share the same designs. While some designs draw inspiration from real world language and culture any associations or symbolism between the characters are incidental.</p>\n<p>The Runelic character set currently supports the following characters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Standard 26 Latin alphabet (upper and lower)</li>\n<li>1234567890</li>\n<li>!\"#$%&amp;'()*+,0-./</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/P4Xi5huA/images/88d1c12d2b6369ed0c05b17c3f4da1e81268880e.png\" alt=\"Signs showing all of the runelic glyphs and the characters they substitute.\" width=\"712\" height=\"390\"></p>\n<h2>Banner Patterns</h2>\n<p>The Runelic mod also includes banner patterns for all 50+ characters added by the font. Players can apply these patterns to their banners by using a Runelic banner stencil item obtained from wandering traders. These patterns provide players with a unique and mystical way to express themselves.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/P4Xi5huA/images/12112e8b10636a734f7a73a6317504a7e9795f88.png\" alt=\"Runelic banner patterns.\" width=\"941\" height=\"498\"></p>\n<h2>Usage Guide</h2>\n<h3>Vanilla Commands &amp; NBT</h3>\n<p>Vanilla commands that allow specifying raw text components can use Runelic by specifying the font ID in the properties of the text. The give command and title command are examples of vanilla commands that allow this.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>/give @p stone{display:{Name:\"[{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Hello\\\",\\\"italic\\\":false,\\\"color\\\":\\\"gold\\\",\\\"font\\\":\\\"runelic:runelic\\\"}]\"}} 1</li>\n<li>/title @a title {\"text\":\"Hello\",\"font\":\"runelic:runelic\"}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bookshelf Commands</h3>\n<p>This mod has a dependency on Bookshelf which offers servers with a number of useful font related commands. These commands will work for Runelic and all other fonts you have installed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>/bookshelf font say runelic:runelic&nbsp; - Posts a chat message using the font.</li>\n<li>/bookshelf font item runelic:runelic - Applies the font to the name of the held item.</li>\n<li>/bookshelf font book runelic:runelic - Applies the font to the name of a held book and all of the book pages.</li>\n<li>/bookshelf font block runelic:runelic x y z - Applies the font to a block entity. Works with signs and nameable blocks like chests.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Code / Modding</h3>\n<p>If you are developing a mod or have access to code/scripting tools you can apply the font to any mutable text component. This is done by setting the font on the style of the component. You can find an example of how I do this in my mods <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.19.4/Common/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/api/util/TextHelper.java#L77-L93\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n<p>The Runelic font and character set is provided with all rights reserved. Projects that have a soft or hard dependency on this mod may use Runelic designs in screenshots, custom assets, character designs, and promotional material. Third paty videos, blogs, articles, showcases, and commentary may also use Runelic in their promotional material and coverage of the project.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

The purpose is to provide functionality for developers to add extra accessory/equipment slots in a convenient and compatible manner, as well as to give users the ability to configure these slots to their preferences. By default, Curios does not add any content except for an inventory GUI. There are no slots and only two items, the latter only being available through the Creative menu and primarily serving as examples for developers to use when coding their own integration.\n\n## Features\n* **Expandable equipment slots through a central library.** New equipment slots can be made and managed easily through an identifier registry. Identical identifiers will be merged together to avoid functional redundancies and provide maximum compatibility to potential items, while unique identifiers can still be used to mark special types when appropriate.\n* **Slots are only made on-demand.** There are no slots included by default, all slots are created only as needed. This reduces instances where one or more superfluous slots are present without any suitable items to go into the slot.\n* **Slots are completely customizable and manipulable.** Slots can have custom backgrounds, different sizes, and can even be disabled or hidden by default. But how would a player even access disabled slots? Through the API, developers can access functions to enable/disable a player's slots or add/remove a certain number of slots of a given type.\n* **Flexible item->curio relations using the vanilla tag system.** Potential curios are selected through the vanilla tag system, which means that categorizing items into curio types is as easy as creating a .json file in the data/curios/tags folder. Items can be categorized into as many curio types as you want as long as they're tagged in the appropriate files, and these settings can even be overridden entirely. For more information, see the vanilla tag system.\n* **Complete integration with other inventory mechanics.** Mending and Curses will work with all applicable items equipped in the curio slots. There are also various minor features for developers that make it simpler to integrate their current items or mechanics into the curio system.\n* **Accessible from a single GUI.** Curios comes with its own GUI accessible from the inventory that shows all of the available slots to a player. This allows players to see all of the extended equipment slots in a central location without needing to access different inventory GUIs. However, developers can still provide their own GUIs for their mod-specific slots if they want. The default keybinding for the GUI is 'g'.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NNByxcQ/curiogui.png)\n\n## Documentation\n* [Setting Up the Development Environment](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/getting-started)\n* [Slots](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/category/slots)\n* [Example Datapack](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/slots/datapack-example)\n* [Slots Configuration](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/configuration)\n* [Commands](https://docs.illusivesoulworks.com/curios/commands)\n* [Legacy Documentation for 1.19.x and Below](https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios/wiki)","published":"2023-02-03T01:35:59.131618Z","updated":"2024-07-02T08:25:22.316663Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1232982,"followers":349,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":["adventure"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ZOlETE5v","RcA3vNIJ","oxBwmsHU","BcHPbGLy","Hm7rMu2c","bE5ThdZW","kWbiHplj","L0vjJCcV","FgmAnDM9","tnz2VF5O","EOOHEkth","vMbFvqVI","T123DHPM","N0zclyEx","WhjxWZUb","9eeEgj08","FK7tyAY3","M9lGrwqm","5qPuCFYD","zkj9iD0D","46cAcdnU","tl7biScA","cpywqo8V","BenekUpa","jVW2AKPB","hTLLayrx","uvQEq1xO","hW3XKfcj","p4wqBrgO","h3K3CopK","SeLn387u","dlv1r8No","GbHsY4Wa","9yUPTnRR","q9hLiOWr","mZaeXk5V","CQtJcas9","Kw26k0tE","XdwwXlEI","HgHicKvP","l0t6GlWP","opCpnbhi","8zBiV8Xc","SdxNj4Fa","BKMikxx0","NI17MAnS","nEba8UUT","9fDBKv2o","wOH4YWOv","y3sKrQEo","RmUMdDtP","odCtDjUV","usPjZolF","VykFFfeC","69B5WqQH","H3lLmHqx","aKokCTY6","nSNsIPLm","sVuCrC2E","DtYuKcQY","3VUlU5Ga","rAPky5mo","iy9E6HF4","qlWryz6z","MjnZWw5h","fPjcw2f6","anCi5HAr","U8r7nIbi","9hjtlBBI","fAlF6Tqn","nxZSj82i","PeTgKttm","t01OqNOZ","LgpxZ1yG","1aZiIHQO","nRQ4FbAf","UfNitWgy","AQ384Hch","1C6lBZmu","L0Tw2xgL","7Wei6s2K","9ro67WYY","adn5hcLm","TOk3Lved","WHmuOhGH","kKPFv8aa","DmFR6XO3","nJQvdzJp","YGa5gGxr","6EgL0aP4","7UxKaIU0","nyvHHyUE","wlGMHF77","29pH8hdz","CP6RHJq7","BiiqnvUy","suXbeF6v","tF9CH5Oa","TeuWjj6h","78rIk4rg","Ao2ykrAI","d3pyf6MJ","moWmAnjY","PEjKT9iG","LlDgDtwS","3XX6mBZ8","g5BlLWVo","LP78nWgP","REeqT3om","uV8dKuBO","NQfh5LGq","iLBQZb4J","S9Xq7LzJ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vvuO3ImH/2a7323ca80849de0bcb50299e18acdf8bf394682.png"},"version":{"id":"moWmAnjY","project_id":"vvuO3ImH","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"curios-forge-5.9.1+1.20.1","version_number":"5.9.1+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\nPrior to version 5.2.0, this project used [Forge Recommended Versioning](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/conventions/versioning/).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies,\nor whatever else you program them to!\n\n![A turtle tunneling in Minecraft.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/turtle.png)\n\nNot all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals\nfor your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your\ncomputers together with modems, and much more.\n\nComputers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item\nmanagement systems.\n\n![A chest's contents being read by a computer and displayed on a monitor.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked/HEAD/doc/images/peripherals.png)\n\n## Getting Started\nWhile ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a\nlittle daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:\n\n - [Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A \"ComputerCraft Tutorial Episode 1 - HELP! and Hello World\")\n - [Sethbling's ComputerCraft series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk \"Programming Tutorial with Minecraft Turtles -- Ep. 1: Intro to Turtles and If-Then-Else_End\")\n - [Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/ \"Computer Basics I\")\n\nOnce you're a little more familiar with the mod, the [wiki](https://tweaked.cc/) provides more detailed documentation on the\nvarious APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.\n\nIf you get stuck, do [ask a question on GitHub][GitHub Discussions] or pop in to the ComputerCraft's [IRC channel][IRC].\n\n## Get Involved\nCC: Tweaked lives on [GitHub].

Cartographer\nThis Minecraft mod adds a peripheral to ComputerCraft Tweaked that allows for interfacing with common mapping plugins (BlueMap, Dynmap, Pl3xMap, and Squaremap).\n\n## Information\nUsing the peripheral, you can dynamically draw POI (including custom icons), lines, circles, rectangles, and arbitrary polygon area markers to the mapping plugin of your choice.\n\nYou can create pathing previews using line markers, add real-time GPS pins for turtles on the move, or (if you have a mod with an entity sensor peripheral) put all the mobs in your area on the map.\n\nSee the

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server. This is port `24454` `UDP` by default.\nWithout opening this port, the voice chat will not work.\nThis port can be changed in the server config.\nMore information [here](https://modrepo.de/minecraft/voicechat/wiki/setup).\n\nThe voice chat is encrypted, but we don't guarantee the security of it.

Or maybe a nether fortress made out of pure magna? Perhaps you are just here to build a house out of dirt or a totem pole with the infamous dioritefaces? Either way we got you covered!\n\nChipped is a 1.16+ building mod that expands on the variety of blocks you can use in-game. The mod offers over 11,000 unique building blocks, from stained glass variations all the way to conerete, prismarine and even gilded blackstone! Not only are all\nthe textures hand-made in the vanilla style, but they also include many connected textures, powered by [Athena](https://modrinth.com/mod/athena-ctm)! \n\nInspired by the popular Chisel mod, Chipped allous builders to have their full range of\ncreativity because every bock deserves a friend!\n\nTo start out all you have to do is craft one of the seven tables that allow you to change various vanilla blocks into their chipped variants. All tables look different, but work the same, so you can pick whichever looks best in your build, or make a few different ones and spread them out in your home. Whatever you want to do, Chipped can help you bring it to life!\n\n---\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r9FApKUUDnE\" title=\"YouTube video player\"

This results in every player on a team owning all blocks that were placed by a player who is also on that same team.\\\nIf you have a mod like *Jade* or *The One Probe* installed, you can see who owns a block in that mod's overlay.\n\n### Reinforced Blocks\nSecurityCraft adds reinforced blocks corresponding to many of the already existing vanilla blocks. These reinforced blocks are unbreakable variants of their vanilla counterpart, and have a slightly darker tint to distinguish them from, but otherwise look the same as, their vanilla versions. This tint can be turned off in the config file. Reinforced blocks are immovable by vanilla pistons, however they can be pushed by reinforced pistons.\\\nNot every vanilla block has a reinforced counterpart, and modded blocks are not and will not be supported by us. That said, there is an easy-to-use API for adding new reinforced blocks, and the team is glad to help out with using it for any mods that want to add reinforced blocks for their own or other mods' blocks.\\\nReinforced blocks are created by reinforcing them with a universal block reinforcer. The different levels simply have more durability, and level 2 upwards can also remove the reinforcement.\\\nHere's a player reinforcing their house:\\\n![In-world reinforcing](https://i.imgur.com/ciac7YL.gif)\n\n### Technical Blocks\nThere are numerous blocks added by the mod, which allow the player to secure their base from intruders. An exhaustive list would be too long for this description, so a few select blocks are outlined below to give you an overview of what to expect in the mod. For a complete list of all of the blocks and items in the mod you can check out the ingame manual, or the [mod's wiki](https://github.com/Geforce132/SecurityCraft/wiki).\n\n- **Block Change Detector**: The block change detector is able to detect block changes in a certain range around it, and will also log the position, player, time, and block state of the changed block.\n- **Fake Liquids**: They look like lava and water, but act completely differently.\\\n![Fake water hurts](https://i.imgur.com/IKUmDWB.gif)\n- **Inventory Scanner**: Previously configured by the owner to prohibit certain items, the inventory scanner can confiscate these prohibited items, or even not let a player having one of these items in their inventory through.\n- **Keycard Reader**: The keycard reader accepts a previously defined set of keycards, and will only emit a redstone signal when the correct card has been inserted.\n- **Projector**: Used to project fake blocks into the world.\\\n![Projector showcase](https://i.imgur.com/xmkz1wr.gif)\n- **Rift Stabilizer**: Can prevent teleportation attempts in its vicinity, disallowing players to use chorus fruit or enderpearls to teleport/glitch into one's base.\n- **Security Camera**: A camera that players can look through from anywhere in their world. Useful for keeping an eye on what those villagers are up to. Or maybe to spy on your enemies.\n- **Sentry**: A defensive device that shoots at approaching mobs.\n- **Trophy System**: Uses laser technology to explode incoming projectiles.\n\n### Modules\nMany of SecurityCraft's blocks can be modified in various ways. This is done through *modules*. They add additional functionality such as redstone output, or allowing the block to act faster than it would without the module. A notable module is the disguise module, which allows SecurityCraft's blocks to look like any other block in the game, allowing for stealthy base defenses.\\\n![Disguise module showcase](https://i.imgur.com/0QfSKPH.gif)\\\nAnother very useful module is the allowlist module, which enables the owner to list names of players in a block. These players are then ignored by the block, and any password-protection, targeting system, etc. that it has.\n\n### Passcode-protected Blocks\nThe mod adds a few passcode-protected blocks that can only be accessed by players who know a numerical code that was previously set by the block's owner. There are a couple passcode-protected blocks that work just like their vanilla counterparts. These blocks include a chest and different furnaces. Most of these do not have a crafting recipe, and are instead created by rightclicking their vanilla variants with a key panel.\nPasscode-protected blocks can be bypassed by the codebreaker. There is a 33% chance of the bypassing succeeding. The item has 3 uses, so handle with care! If the codebreaker is successful, the block will activate/open, and the player can access it.\nIf you have a mod like Jade¬†or The One Probe¬†installed, you can see the passcode of your own passcode-protected blocks. This can be turned off, and only the owner can see the passcode. As of SecurityCraft v1.9.7, no one can see the passcode anymore, not even with the help of mods.\n\n### Explosives\nThere are many mines added by SecurityCraft that players can use as defensive measures. A special type of mine are the so called block mines, which mimic commonly found blocks such as stone, dirt, deepslate, or sand, as well as all existing ores. These mines look just the same as their normal variants, however they are explosive to the touch. If a player who is not the owner breaks such a block mine, it will explode and leave a fiery crater.\\\n![Block mine showcase](https://i.imgur.com/MkJ0S4P.gif)\\\nThe mod also has other explosive gadgets. These include a standard mine that explodes when being stepped on, and a device that shoots mines at nearby mobs. All of these mines can be accessed by the mine remote access tool. Rightclicking a mine with the tool binds the mine to it, and subsequently allows to remotely defuse, arm, or detonate it.\n\n### Showcase\nNoxus created a very good showcase of the mod, highlighting key features and explaining the basics, as well as explaining all the blocks in the mod (as of v1.9.5).

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

14px;\"><strong>Better Tridents</strong> brings some small, but much need improvements to tridents. Especially the loyalty enchantment is much more useful, and there's even a crafting recipe for tridents themselves!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üìö Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Tridents Finally Have A Crafting Recipe!</strong> No longer will you solely receive this ancient weapon from a reskinned zombie: Every noticed how there are three elder guardians in an ocean monument, and a trident has exactly three jags? Well, that's not a coincidence anymore! Each elder guardian will drop a <strong>Trident Fragment</strong>; combine those with a few prismarine shards, and there's your brand new trident!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">But what do you do when your trident is about to run out of durability? Simple: <strong>Repair It With Some Prismarine Shards</strong> using an anvil! Why do you even ask, that's obvious, isn't it?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Let's talk about the loyalty enchantment: So your trident comes back to you, nice. But where does it go? Somewhere in your inventory to dig up again? And when you throw it into the void in the End, it's just gone. And what about all the fancy loot from the mobs you've slain, you need to go over there to collect it. Really? Well, all fixed: Tridents always return to the slot they are thrown from (even without loyalty), when thrown into the void they return, and any loot dropped by mobs will come flying at you together with the trident itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Besides that, <strong>Impaling Works As It Does On Bedrock Edition</strong>: any mob in contact with water or rain will receive increased damage. This is especially great, since tridents now finally work against those annoying drowneds infesting your beautiful oceans.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lHSmULI.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üì∑ Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/965/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/491/966/2022-08-31_22.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tridents with loyalty collect all drops for you</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Your trident is damaged?

This allows for much more advanced and flexible sensors\n\n<h3>Advanced behaviours</h3>\n\nUtilise built-in, or create new behaviours based on an extensible behaviour class, which builds in callbacks, predication, cooldowns, and more.\n\n<h3>Runtime-safe behaviour modification</h3>\n\nAdd, remove, and modify behaviours dynamically from an existing entity.\n\n<h3>Optimisation</h3>\n\nSBL replaces almost the entirety of the vanilla brain system's functions, using high-efficiency functions to remove the inefficiencies in as many areas as possible of the brain. Done right, an SBL entity could be even more efficient than one using goals!\n\n<h3>Additional sensors, behaviours, and memory types</h3>\n\nSBL builds in additional modules for use in any entity, with more to come over time.\n\n<h3>Added utility functions</h3>\n\nAs well as the expected brain functionality, SBL additionally adds additional helpers, such as:\n<ul>\n<li>Optimised level entity-getter functions</li>\n<li>Developer-friendly Random library</li>\n<li>Brain interface utility for adding/removing brain content from non-SBL entities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How do I use it?</h2>\n\nThe library is documented on its <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/wiki\">Wiki Page</a>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\nIf you have issues or want to contribute, please jump on the <a href=\"https://github.com/Tslat/SmartBrainLib/issues\">Github Page</a> and make your voice

The updating process is also made easier when there's an improvement for a function that is relevant to many others. For example this means having to update one project, instead of six. This saves time and makes me a little happier.</span><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #000000;\">Manages all config files of dependent mods.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #000000;\">Variables for increased compatibility with other projects.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #000000;\">Functions that convert data for mods.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #000000;\">An event to replace and resupply entities.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #000000;\">Networking code to send packets via the Common source set.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #000000;\">Centralized backwards compatibility for major version changes.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Configurable:</span> <span style=\"color: #008000; font-size: 14px;\"><a style=\"color: #008000;\" title=\"how\" href=\"https://serilum.com/how-to-configure-mods/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">(&nbsp;how do I configure?&nbsp;)</a></span></strong><strong><br />transferItemsBetweenReplacedEntities</strong>&nbsp;(default = true): When enabled, transfer the held items and armour from replaced entities by any of the Entity Spawn mods which depend on Collective.<br /><strong>loopsAmountUsedToGetAllEntityDrops</strong>&nbsp;(default = 100, min 1, max 200): The amount of times Collective loops through possible mob drops to get them all procedurally.

Mekanism is an *experience* that will forever change the way you play Minecraft.\n\nHere at Mekanism, Inc., we bring you a suite of low, mid, and high tier machinery to elevate your archaic home and inefficient resource processing to the 21st century. With our collection of high-tech tools, high-end energy generators, advanced transmission systems and intricate processing mechanisms, you‚Äôll find yourself relieved of the tedious tasks of ‚Äòmining‚Äô and ‚Äòcrafting‚Äô and quickly progressing to new levels of technological enlightenment.\n\nYou may not realize it, but every time you smelt an ore directly into its respective ingot, you‚Äôre wasting the majority of what you‚Äôve mined. Mekanism‚Äôs team of experienced chemical and mechanical engineers have developed advanced ore processing machinery to extract resources from ores with utmost efficiency. With our purification, dissolution, chemical injection, and crystallization technologies, you can now double, triple, quadruple, even *quintuple* your ingot production per ore, given enough infrastructure and energy.\n\nOur engineering team understands and embraces gradual technological progression. For whatever stage of gameplay you‚Äôve reached, we offer a tier of machinery to suit your needs. Every Mekanism machine can be upgraded to a factory, allowing you to process, 3 (basic), 5 (advanced), 7 (elite), or even 9 (ultimate) different items at once -- in a single machine! No more are the rows, even *walls* of slow and ugly furnaces that once plagued your home. Condense your machinery infrastructure with Mekanism today.\n\nJust a few of the many reasons Mekanism will be the highlight of your Minecraft experience:\n- Hydrogen-powered **Jetpacks**, with multiple togglable flight modes\n- A small, cute, and loyal robotic friend (**Robit**!) to follow you around\n- A **Digital Miner** with state-of-the-art filtering technologies to automate your mining needs\n- A **Fusion Reactor** which uses advanced [internal confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_confinement_fusion) technology to harness the power of the sun to run advanced machinery (*requires Mekanism Generators*)\n- Various transmitters for transferring items, fluids, gases, energy, and even heat!\n- An effective machinery configuration system, which allows for the creation of advanced item transport networks capable of sorting and filtering (using our patented **Logistical Transporters**!)\n\nLinks to other Mekanism modules:\n- [Mekanism Additions](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-additions)\n- [Mekanism Generators](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-generators)\n- [Mekanism Tools](https://modrinth.com/mod/mekanism-tools)\n\n<br>\n\nWe **HIGHLY RECOMMEND** playing Mekanism with CyanideX's Unity: Dark Edition resource pack.\n- [Unity: Dark Edition](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity-dark-edition/)\n- [Classic Unity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity/)","published":"2022-05-27T00:12:09.740488Z","updated":"2024-07-02T23:33:34.609783Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":249042,"followers":293,"categories":["equipment","storage","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.7.10","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.21"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["gqJMEABX","wukmoSeF","4QWCUteA","ruRBKgwc","KIzASRO5","dZZ4j18G","4IEoyWzh","IDjtJsDR","ZrS7qENE","nDxFueG2","DlhxRTKL","atcAq1UT","Pz4thLN2","ppz3xziS","g74zfl0m","RGlXXgcD","zWt8Aemn","zLHaraw3","yDOSRo2r","6zqf3EGe","OFopgIFW","xKRR7R7a","RBifwW3R","TAyUJAKw","X58zIngK","CgFgCgTf","yj7d33HE","MLG4wWo6","W5PUUWt9","GxZSvUQi","5fXP0XBe","52nOMLHi","gNIc57RO","eVOeDNA3","aYZg5gr4","ITHqRXF6","H8bgSedJ","JzPscbhA","nKXR4Epk","JorNeGyn","SsMYCLyo","ymNS7Xu4","b6FomViI","294wJ15t","TRHlTRLN","yIGbm770","qb6SolDK","POJlYRhY","L8Ew5o4z","Tk6qda6I","CzRJjYwn","pMSK4H9M","VT5mybN7","3uqZ9TUK","bmewZnUP","Lu1y7Y2N","2Xnt7wI1","jxR9mmIK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Ce6I4WUE/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"VT5mybN7","project_id":"Ce6I4WUE","author_id":"81DWsUKb","featured":false,"name":"10.4.8.43","version_number":"10.4.8.43","changelog":"<a href=\"https://github.com/mekanism/Mekanism/commit/b73f09ddcdcd0915d6acc12be764ca60a593773c\">b73f09d</a> -

This mod adds a hand full of peripherals that allow futher access to Creates features.\n\n## Content\n> üëâ _**Create** now actually has native support for **CC: Tweaked** too! But why stop there?_\n\n- **Two essential blocks of this mod are the `Source Block` and `Target Block`.**\nThey simulate a source or target, making it possible to comunicate within every other source/target that **Create** provides.\n\n- Another block that can come in very handy is the `RedRouter Block`.\nIt can send or receive redstone signals without having to worry about wireless channels or by using multible Computers, using the Redstone API.\n\n- This mod also adds some smaller, fun things like the `Scroller Pane` or `Animatronic`. The Scroller Pane lets you select a number and send it to a Computer using **Creates** interface, while the Animatronic is a puppet you can [control and animate as you like!](https://youtu.be/MI_tHMHrAY0)\n\n### Psst, hey! Why don't you check out the gallery as well?\n\n## Tutorials\n_But how do I use the peripherals?_ Good question! We are constantly updating **our [wiki section](https://cccbridge.tweaked-programs.cc/)**, in order to make it easy for you developers to keep up with all the changes! **We now switched to our own domain for this!**\n\n> üëâ _Just like **CC: Tweaked**, we try to keep backwards compatibility as much as possible! Because of **Creates** nature of updating things, we can't guarantee this however._\n\n---\n\n# Happy coding and producing!\n","published":"2022-08-04T21:38:14.402877Z","updated":"2023-11-13T16:44:57.559200Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":90454,"followers":137,"categories":["technology","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["6gFSB2cb","SHtSVyPj","4FAugHCK","RmMbmMxs","TSlKJnFI","Pu6WWjXy","F6VLKITg","kqa9TcGO","nefRvVSC","GfPgRnaJ","Lak8yNkA","mEqr6s4n","hcUse6zC","JWA3Ln0O","VUgVNrXb","bm4MC9fD","GJHezNYH","7ZMkp8vc","wCHQIZkL","ajroWplh","ZQr9o4rM","48CSf0v7","3iyZZsnj","kriL4Yqq","wJFFxsk3","S5lsxWv6","57pJUQQM","sPKVzUaW"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fXt291FO/0a7670a36212340465e689bbd107e921a45065ad.webp"},"version":{"id":"sPKVzUaW","project_id":"fXt291FO","author_id":"wq0m29UH","featured":false,"name":"CC:C Bridge 1.6.3-forge","version_number":"1.6.3-forge","changelog":"**_Forge port after later ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è_**\n- Applied base code from Fabric _(see [changelog](https://modrinth.com/mod/cccbridge/changelog?l=fabric&g=1.20.1) of 1.6.X from fabric)_\n- Fixed missing translations for paintings\n- Fixed typos in German translation\n- Updated CC:T to 1.108.4\n- Updated Create to 0.5.1.d-9\n\n_Note: CC:C Config screen is not accessible.

It presents a tech-based, futuristic theme, centered around the concept of using energy and technology to convert matter into energy and vice versa. Please come visit our [homepage](https://appliedenergistics.github.io/) or chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne).\n\n![image of subnetworks from the guidebook](https://guide-assets.appliedenergistics.org/minecraft-1.20.1/ae2/ae2-mechanics/subnetworks_scene1.njRxulYCJ84v.png)\n\nKey features of the mod include:\n\n**Storage Systems**: AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items.\n\n**Auto-Crafting**: Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort.\n\n**Networking and Channels**: AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system. Devices connected to the same network can communicate and interact with each other, and the channel system limits the number of devices that can be connected to a single cable, adding a layer of planning and organization to your builds.\n\n**Spatial Storage**: This feature allows players to store entire regions of space within a spatial storage cell. Essentially, you can take a chunk of the world, including all blocks, items, and entities within, and store it digitally to be released later.\n\n**Unique Resources**: AE2 introduces several new resources and materials for crafting its technological components, such as Certus Quartz, Fluix Crystals, and Inscribers. Many of these new materials come with their own decorative blocks to spice up your builds.\n\nAE2 is known for the complexity and depth it adds to Minecraft's tech gameplay, encouraging players to create, optimize, and manage large-scale, efficient systems. It is a fantastic mod for those who love to automate processes and manage resources efficiently.","published":"2021-12-14T11:50:43.324146Z","updated":"2024-07-01T11:03:56.592645Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":604266,"followers":565,"categories":["storage","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["OqkivEmV","DZZbZnbH","cLm6eoS7","Bf4qfsQf","6AN4WLgf","n6ctl28A","ePPHPjw7","EkIUZgzp","uWZo3axN","kOb7LSAK","pRtKJO4l","2TIYWbvo","aUAC5DXB","mlkfFOT9","Q6LSGEqw","f0cVzJbq","xKkeaqkM","2OY506tW","LmtoNQhm","Ieppgyii","XSv7aCzj","7rSpITeE","Z32dIodF","fMM2pwnM","Woty8glY","NFcpTG3k","W5IItIBw","xDGpy4Qn","ByV6cOMZ","nZG3f7mn","697yLiPU","fjroW9SS","BF8g0TZ3","sWmGENVC","qosXJAjq","OiY2lfg0","3FuIT2JI","5KhL4WhW","RWto5Lhw","wHN8x90L","sm5CvPw0","oMLKu1Ze","nuYdiTZB","oLeqpmhw","mV6fTxoi","kOcIph1U","HJrR1zgA","JSwFZQ02","aR5tGCcS","s3g4KtWI","enxs5scj","9WXP1AHX","mv6YbdV3","7Gq3qbtw","bD9ZXRfC","7UmbOb4g","WVYkyvRH","bpkm2yMw","C5nwXELu","ZaNpnMCh","OFBWYrp4","PvPdRUHX","PDkmB4UV","zkC0WSUn","Z6jnGDF9","5xa1OSzf","5EyIPVWA","XVFb5sJ7","WzDBx3u7","YNFx3Hjn","nrq8eC4Q","6VmOchNB","9XtLETKp","hCIvVRgg","RFmdcgz3","vrdekdmw","Z8OKgUoh","P4SHVMac","25KjhlGv","S3K8G49B","6qQEQmM8","36EMfB3q","DZd4yQe4","c3zEVaQ8","wYymrhE4","8HeKobcP","yz68xU3j","pcHc3tZs","MrXpPIvo","aszqg0Wn","WAh5HPC8","RgkwNSjT","62yssi1E","A5FUIGjh","q5TQ3zgd","9P35YnKN","ix3GcoBP","RJnK9Ovj","MoGLgJK1","t3aUE6HS","7NWAte1m","PWdOzVug","HQd68kb6","lp2vAcHP","c0KKkf1Z","zhr2jXaL","9evKVcVd","MPdVG6oo","COSdQAoF","TBVf9h2p","CKA0xF7f","GL3uhBGD","brl6VeNy","TMEAMYIx","g7uJnOOS","sALiGsl3","yIupDKor","oAGWsu3M","JRLfd73N","UAuf0uiD","3Mvq6QHo","L6VGYHd3","y5W8KGqT","xGjt6qMm","sOqmy2ww","COba8tGt","8C4WbuoI","NX3fAZif","DsTIvcA1","Tw8kyhfI","NHcKcc8c","Xc1WEGPd","1HKx8M9v","qf2Yz73T","8HEK7sk8","ijZQY1Rd","xzP4cydc","a5pC6xdL","QalOLGBM","RpMpf7zi","Zrp3c9yN","7vB6vk2v","7ACUdipn","Sz6f1zJd","qfpQmwll","lePuKDdy","TKhjxSIB","oS3Ga2mY","7j0MvcB1","IcREcVDb","Mdn0ka1O","AxEi5RIz","b13bPfeM","rLjoLUTF","wGIGpPsQ","tifFqBKk","W4efZESl","lThI0ayT","qBbqV301","l3tOwBzj","LxjXwNSj","Bj8oQseU","IWm9cQdw","CkK2zzkf","xUoHYNEg","5cb16tgY","HAKkYcmv","1kT0YXJf","BUHQD4RJ","lT1sdBmI","fwLnPXom","8edEAu2V","aQH6ftSR","U3MExcIx","OIOSSXhK","Cf5vGMwV","XfVOZDN8","jgICE67P","nhQTb3m4","ZVjAvWE5","MNGBfmiy","b1U0ez1e","fFh1IdTY","fugqOJWC","LznTi8p2","dhrGFcqh","VI3B0aKr","ibJ4Ydxw","ZBr63LNs","qGKR0YVC","d1AtkO1b","3ZI8DotD","YO5wVxT7","XCXfEG6G","hNV0u2Ke","GkAgfE4B","u5dC9pjL","ZZZyMiY4","NmC7F1OZ","i1h1wOhr","3fQeIJU2","Hnumk0Bl","RQKXi0Jk","ZyC52h3W","SK6yn8MM","w2R8hIML","WJVipmUL","pThfoWlc","D7bfN7hf","QV62CH9w","BZL7JFgj","uAI0bShS","kP2VZhqZ","4I61MxJa","pHuguX3Y","hYG5tbva","FNy8w4ic","UmQtYI0G","792UNplB","Euz9WnGy","JWh6WyXU","FzURHfti","RpmE1nzj","UvErlgaY","xn5sieSc","Lo9sz0BU","pUCfuoqf","EtNeQMla","OK01nNQM","WIIZmqs6","kywcQ25B","isHbiIeZ","pGnl32B8","tjB3sQ3W","NoFBkXQe","9Vscdpuz","CEmkqbKV","qpG9cRjY","fZYI0nmw","mfB8KDaB","L3u3Zbmr","Fx9uV7AL","eQcAHHqJ","4AsGT2cN","WTviSGxg","Q6wAB4Fm","RyqiiHUt","NsFt2Dws","G13uBrme","v48VlCNF","45j4Lh8t","7VNKQE9m","o7nZu2n5","3w98zsYp","9RulCOOy","hZu6jr2B","INdhXaep","fg8ibB1d"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/XxWD5pD3/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"fg8ibB1d","project_id":"XxWD5pD3","author_id":"3HAu37Rl","featured":true,"name":"AE2

To resolve this issue, you'll need to perform a block update on affected bridges or stairs. Here's how:\n\nPlace any block above/next to the affected bridge or stairs, or break and replace the affected bridge or stairs, which will trigger an update for neighboring bridges.\n\nWe highly recommend creating backups of your existing game worlds before applying this update.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\nPerformance:\n- Made many changes, to reduce the memory usage as much as I could, lowered memory usage by 80-90%.\n- Refactored code to be more efficient and optimized\n- Lowered the count of all blockstates by 85 - 89 % \n  ( From 13920 to 1516 )\n- Removed lots of model.jsons and made them more efficient\n\n\nAdded :\n- Stone Bridges, Stairs, Piers have new variations \n  ( nether bricks, mossy cobblestone, cobblestone, end stone bricks,\n   prismarine bricks, andesite, granite, diorite )\n- New Balustrade Stone Bridges ( 17 variations )\n- Red Asian Bridge, Support, Stairs\n- Glass Bridge, Support, Stairs\n\n\nBridge Torch & Lantern:\n- Can be placed on bridge/bridge stairs railings ( They have a tooltip )\n- Cannot be placed in the middle\n- They break if there is no solid block below them\n\n\nBridge Piers:\n- Can now be waterlogged (again!..)\n- Have a new model\n\n\nChanges:\n- Most bridges have an improved model\n- All Bridges have now the same height (base/railings), this change fixes the no step sounds whilst walking on a bridge\n- Removed Torches in bridges, made separate torches which can be placed on bridge/bridge stair railing ( to prevent doubling the states because of this..)\n- Rope Bridges have only 2 facing sides, north and east. Since west and south would be the same as north and east, we decided to merge it so it wont create redundant blockstates\n- Bridge handrails/handguards have been reworked, you can now toggle between all 4 sides or empty platform, with this change you can modify bridges like never before\n- Bridges have an updated placing mechanism, if you place a bridge while on a bridge, it will place down a bridge in the way you are facing ( Similar to the scaffolding )\n- Bridge Stairs have also an updated placing mechanism, if you place the stair on the stair, it will build another stair one block behind and above it, this way you can easily build bridge stairs upwards.\n- Shears can be used like pliers\n- Bridges now have a tooltip about Pliers/Shears\n- Bridges and Stairs cannot be placed directly above themselves, this makes it easier to build\n- Bridge Piers/Supports no longer connect but they have an improved model to make them look just as good as before\n- All Stone recipes can now be crafted in the stonecutter too\n- Bridges now have the tag Trapdoors, this is because entities are pathfinding it when it has the tag...\n\n\nNew Translations:\nfr_fr by Calvineries\nko_kr by spinodal23\nuk_ua by Moonvvell\nes_cl by Ganbare-Lucifer\n\n\nUpdated Translations:\nru_ru by mindryder\nde_de by PatrickK01\nes_es by Divinium115\n\n\nIssues Fixed:\n- Bridges have no step sound\n- Wrong breaking sounds on a few blocks\n- Wrong hardness on some blocks\n- Bridge Piers/Supports cannot be waterlogged\n- Two Wide Bridges don't connect to stairs\n- Stone and Log Bridges have wrong texture for bottom\n- Wrong texture UV size on some stairs\n- Iron Bridge can be used as fuel\n- Bridge stairs alignment is weird\n- Z-fighting on some bridges and stairs\n- Pliers do not appear in creative menu or JEI\n- Pliers unable to make a bridge fully open\n- Bamboo and Dry Bamboo Bridges and Stairs do not fully\n  connect\n- Missing mcw tags from some blocks\n- Mobs Pathfinding get stuck on bridge ( They now walk correctly on the base bridge, but when there is a block with handrail they will jump-move, but they are now pathfinding bridges )\n- Bridge Support is not a full block\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-06T14:41:15.207145Z","downloads":30397,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"55bbc972179c77266bb709a0b177a9f772e34824","sha512":"9cdd7815dee642844ffea18bf66182093f3a52e34c6690dab76099a3aa195d19e6db2c50b96b7e5c5b4ed9131b718f795d0c927abf0f5aa18e85aaceafdd24f8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GURcjz8O/versions/wJ0BHouQ/mcw-bridges-3.0.0-mc1.20.1forge.jar","filename":"mcw-bridges-3.0.0-mc1.20.1forge.jar","primary":true,"size":677705,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"w0R55u0J","user":{"id":"HTw9s4lh","username":"sketchmacaw","name":"Sketch Macaw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60577275?v=4","bio":"Welcome to my profile!

Citadel, being a Library, does not add many features by itself, but rather provides a frame work for other mods when it comes to animating entities, loading .tbl Tabula and .obj Waveront models, and for keeping track of entity properties. Citadel's predecessor, LLibrary, will no longer be updated from 1.12.2, and from now on all of my mods will use Citadel. Citadel's code base is largely derived from LLibrary, and the code is used with permission from Gegy1000, the maintainer of LLibrary and its author in recent versions.\n\n \n\nIn versions 1.6.3 and above, there is also a config option for changing the cap on how many mobs spawn on chunk generation.

The Botany Pot can be used for decoration, and to also make farming certain types of crops much easier. This mod was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/davenonymous/followers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Davenonymous's</a> awesome <a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/bonsai-trees\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bonsai Trees</a> mod.</p>\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Harvesting a crop in a Botany Pot will automatically replant the seed.</li>\n<li>Hopper Botany Pot upgrade allows the pot to harvest itself and put items in a chest or other block with an inventory.</li>\n<li>Seventeen different colors!</li>\n<li>Extensive <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/Datapack-Information\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack support</a> for adding new crops, soils, and fertilizers.</li>\n<li>Extensive <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/CraftTweaker-Support#fertilizers\" rel=\"nofollow\">support for CraftTweaker</a> to allow removing, modifying, and adding crops, soils, and fertilizers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>First you need to craft the Botany Pot. Then you must think about the type of crop you want to grow and the soil it grows in. There are many kinds of soil blocks and certain crops will need certain soils. A good example of this is wheat growing in dirt and nether wart growing in soul sand. Once you have the soil and seed for your crop simply right click the block with your soil and then your seed. This will start the growth process for your crop. The crop may take a while to grow, you can speed it up by right clicking with bone meal and other fertilizers. Once the crop is done growing right click it to harvest and automatically plant another. To remove items from the botany pot you can sneak and right click the block with an empty hand. Breaking the block will also work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>While this mod may seem simple on it's surface, there are many technical details involved. For those who would like to get a better understanding of the mod you can read the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki/Technical-Info\" rel=\"nofollow\">Technical Information</a> page on the wiki.</p>\n\n<h2>Mod Support</h2>\n<p>This mod uses predefined json files to add support for crops. These json files let you do things like define soils, fertilizers, and new crops. Mod authors and servers can easily add these files to their data packs to customize crops. Additionally users can create and share their own data packs to enable a broader range of mod support.&nbsp; If you would like to add new data for the mod please check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/BotanyPots/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki</a> for more information about the mod and where to get help.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Currently Supported</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biomes O' Plenty (15 crops, 3 soils)</li>\n<li>Botania (32 crops, 7 soils, 1 fertilizer)</li>\n<li>Buzzier Bees (13 crops)</li>\n<li>Metal Bushes (6 crops)</li>\n<li>Mystical Agriculture(43 crops, 5 soils, 1 fertilizer)</li>\n<li>Harvestcraft (78 crops)</li>\n<li>Peanut Mod (1 crop)</li>\n<li>Quark (1 crop, 1 soil)</li>\n<li>Simple Farming (34 crops)</li>\n<li>Snad (2 soils)</li>\n<li>XL Food Mod (6 crops)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Like the mod and want to support me?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

This will then override the default creation of the `server.properties` file. The beauty of this method is that you only need to set the properties that you want to change by default in the `default-server.properties` as the game's native loading will take care of the rest.\n\n## How to use\n\nCreate a `default-server.properties` file in the games root folder. If there is no `default-used.marker` in the `local` folder, then the mod will attempt to load that default data in and inject it to the normal default creation of the `server.properties`... simples.\n","published":"2023-09-08T01:43:34.400253Z","updated":"2024-06-15T23:16:52.277596Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":11639,"followers":5,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["hD34LqaO","hf40UJ8J","x8LSejaq","8UWHvTrY","9JSnGLfH","9nsveZsV","rzHLogCR","VIMWIGwj","s8QXWIvZ","vmeNbbJL","SnYeQRxM","eAnkUTz2","qR6T60nT","zTrlOCxQ","iaKkMvEK","DsohIvkV","BijmAbAA","yPw917C4","yeiEU3a8","cvFhabvI","BBUsBdvi","sO45vwSX","ccw2t3DY","H0OIrkrn","TSS8HzVX","RnxqWPH3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Fnrzx9Jl/d0a100868da765979e1538efe769bf1d5c879580.png"},"version":{"id":"x8LSejaq","project_id":"Fnrzx9Jl","author_id":"8EAEHww7","featured":false,"name":"default-server-properties-forge-81.1.0.jar","version_number":"81.1.0","changelog":"\\[81.1.0\\]\n----------\n\n### Changed\n\n*   Ported to 1.20.1","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-08T01:44:07.270569Z","downloads":5168,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"1317295ae93ed2c2bdd34dd1502e3eeb5a9945c7366867b8e3875d93bb442320af5e0a13f74efba35a8b60d89f0daf263f69f57670fb0fd60e99534ac2d913fc","sha1":"040e4cfde815d022cc3899ba0ef290a9843a47c8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Fnrzx9Jl/versions/x8LSejaq/default-server-properties-forge-81.1.0.jar","filename":"default-server-properties-forge-81.1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":8113,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"b0GVuGHG","user":{"id":"2meoiAYJ","username":"Nanite","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/2meoiAYJ/0713bb10de13060b4eb11fdc97d408d5e65012e6.jpeg","bio":null,"created":"2023-08-03T16:24:36.817065Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"b0GVuGHG","user":{"id":"8EAEHww7","username":"ErrorMikey","name":"ErrorMikey","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12798904?v=4","bio":"Go away","created":"2021-06-08T23:45:30.558244Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"default-server-properties-forge-81.1.0.jar"},"mods\\genshinstrument-1.20+1.20.1-3.4.1.jar":{"sha512":"f407913201b1581de92d27869ca2c55f084a259a6dd818728faa449645ed9327e6c96a8a883d7d6edd8d89da9dc052f9f8365d191f3fb9e6ad176add19986a8e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"UUD6Qkij","slug":"genshin-instruments","project_type":"mod","team":"GGbq5SpS","title":"Genshin Instruments","description":"A mod that adds Genshin Impact's set of instruments into Minecraft!","body":"<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Z2BN6Y6/banner.png\" alt=\"Mod Banner - Genshin Instruments\" width=\"1000\" border=\"0\" /></p><center>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><h2 style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Add Genshin Impact's set of instruments to your own Minecraft experience, and play your favorite songs with the familiar keybindings!</h2></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></span><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Looking for <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/evenmoreinstruments\">even more instruments</a>? üëÄ<br /></span><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">(New to playing?

Please add the correct version to your mod folder.\n\nTo use the in-game manual you need the mod¬†Patchouli¬†in your pack.\n\n\n## THE EXTREME REACTOR API\n\nThe API jar is available on my maven rep:¬†https://maven.zerono.it/\n\n\n## NOTABLE CHANGES SINCE 1.12.2\n\n\n**Turbine Coils update! (versions 2.0.38 and following)**\n\nThere are now three new (one is making its comeback) late/end game coils for extracting a huge amount of power from your Turbines:¬†Ludicrite, Ridiculite and Inanite. You should expect around 45K / 75K / 115K FE/t from a full coil in a Reinforced Turbine from each of them.\n\nMod(-pack) authors can now use the /er coils command to fine tune any new coil they add to ER\n\n\n**The Fluid Fuels update!¬† (version¬†1.16.5-2.0.32 /¬†1.17.1-2.0.32¬†and following)**\n\nExtreme Reactors now support fuels (and wastes) reactants in fluid form that you can insert in your Reactors without any material loss using the new Fuel Injection Port set in inlet mode. Fluid wastes will be ejected into an Injection Port set in outlet mode.\n\nHow will you make fluid fuels? With a new multiblock machine: the Fluidizer!\n\nYou will need a Controller, a Power Port, an Output Port and the usual mix of Casing and Glass parts (if you like the Glass, right now the fluid is not rendered inside the multiblock). There are two kind of Injector Ports that will let you insert material in the Fluidizer:\n\n- the Fluidizer Solid Injector for solid ingots or blocks\n- the Fluidizer Fluid Injector for liquid fuels\n\nOne Solid Injector will let you convert your solid fuel to it's fluid form\n\nTwo Solid Injectors will let to convert and mix two different solid fuels into a new type of fluid fuel\n\nTwo Fluid Injectors will let you convert and mix two different fluid fuels into a new type of fluid fuel\n\nMixing fuels with usually give you a better fuel than the original ones\n\nPlease check in JEI for the recipes (more recipes can be added using Vanilla recipe system)\n\n- All fuels and wastes in fluid form can be placed in the world. It will be probably not a good idea to swim in them\n\n- Added the Verderium fuel. The top tier fuel\n\n- Added the Rossinite waste. It will make you go fast like the GOAT\n\n- Added /er command (op level 2+). Useful for pack authors to fine tune fuel values\n\n\n**The Fuel Update (version¬†1.16.5-2.0.29 / 1.17.1-2.0.29 and following)\n\nExtreme Reactors now support fuels reactants that produce¬†fuels with different properties¬†from each other. This allow ER and mods / modpacks to add different kind of fuels using the ER API (FuelProperties / ReactantsRegistry) or the API modpack-wrapper. If no fuel properties are specified for new fuels reactants, the default ones (Yellorium) are used. This will allow the creations of other fuels by mixing existing ones, once liquid fuels are finalized.\n\nBlutonium¬†is back as a full-fledged reactant and fuel, with a better yield than Yellorium (keep in mind that it's properties are not set in stone right now), and it's \"crafted\" by reprocessing Cyanite.\n\nBlutonium will turn into¬†Magentite, a new waste-type reactant, after being used in the Reactor. There is currently no use for it in the mod, but who knows what will happen in the future.\n\n\n**The Reprocessor (version¬†1.16.5-2.0.29 and following)\n\nA new multiblock machine that's able to¬†reprocess wastes into new fuels. You will use it, for example, to craft¬†Blutonium¬†from Cyanite (check the recipe in JEI).\n\nThe Reprocessor is a 3x3x7 (x/z/y, external dimiensions) multiblock build using Reprocessor Casing blocks for the frame or faces. Reprocessor Glass blocks can be used instead of Casing on the faces. You need one (and only one) of each of the other Reprocessor parts (Controller, Collector, Waste Injector, Fluid Injector, Output Port, Power Port). The Waste Inject goes in the top face, the Collector on the bottom face. The other ones can go on any vertical face.\n\nThe Reprocessor recipes use an item and a fluid to craft another item. Mods and modpacks authors can add they own recipes in the usal ways. The Reprocessor need 1000 FE to process a single recipe. You can check the available recipes in JEI.\n\n\n**1.16.x / 1.17.x\n\n- In-game documentation is available with the The Extreme Book! (you need¬†Patchouli too)\n\n- The Reactor and Turbine comes in two initial variants: Basic and Reinforced\n\nThe Basic variant is your early game choice: cheap and small (5x5x5 max for the Reactor, 5x5x10 for the Turbine)\n\nThe Reinforced variant if your heavy duty one: machines as big as you want (check your server config file) and build from steel ingots (or a botload of iron if your pack lack steel)\n\n- The internal buffers (energy / fluids) size of any Reactors and Turbines is a function of the machine size.\n\n- There are now two general tipes of Power Taps and Fluid Ports: active and passive\n\n¬†- an Active one will send out power or fluids (or retrive them) automatically to the block connected to it\n\n¬†- a Passive one will send out power or fluids (or accept them) ony if the block connected to it request it\n\n¬†- using both types allow you to fine tune your energy or fluids distribution network\n\n- The Access Port has gone Solid ... the old girl is not as good as it was in the past at converting fuel ingots to liquid fuel. But it's still does a good jot at it\n\n- The Fuel Rod rendesing is even more FPS¬†friendlier than before. You should have not rendering performance problems even with a huge number of Fuel Rods in your Reactors\n\n-¬†Reactor / Turbine Forge Energy Charging Port. Use it to charge items that use energy (FE) to operate. Open the GUI and put the item in the input slot in the center (more info in the book).\n\n- Turbine Rotor can be build with any combinatios of blades you want (provided that their variant match the Turbine's and, well, it is a valid rotor :)) and will be animated using the shape you build\n\n- New fancy¬†and FPS friendly GUI because i like fancy stuff and you like your FPSs\n\n- The Reinforced Computer Port support CC-Tweaked LUA program to help you manage your Reactors and Turbines\n\n- Modpack authors can use the Creative Water Generator / Steam Generator to create self sustaining Turbines setups or as a rare loot for their players\n\n- Ore-regen: the mod can re-generate it's ores by setting the¬†\"enableWorldRegeneration\" config option to true.¬†\n\nWorldgen must be enabled too, and so does the specific ore options you want to re-generate. If you need to re-generate chunks again, increate the value of the config option \"userWorldGenVersion\"\n\n\n## ABOUT A JEI PLUGIN\n\nAs you may have noticed, ER do not come with a JEI plugin that list all the moderators, fuels, coils, etc and their properties. The reason is simple: I don't want to have one. It would be no fun having the answer to \"what's work best\" outside the game, instead have fun and experiment!\n\nSince there are tons of blocks and items in any modern pack, in 2.0.6 I've added a tooltip to items and blocks that could be used as fuel or moderators for the Reactors or Turbine coils. It's an advanced tooltip so you need to enable them to spoil your fun :) There is also a client config option to disable them if needed\n\nI'm planning to have an in-game method to test your Reactor designs without having to build a whole one. The key code is already in place and Reactors and Turbines can already run in simulation mod\n\nAlso, to my fellow modders: please DO NOT add an external JEI plugin that show fuels, moderators, etc, for my mod, thank you.\n\n\n## MODPACKS AND LET'S PLAYs AND OTHER PERMISSIONS\n\nYou can add Extreme Reactors 2 (and Zero Core 2) to your mod pack or use them in your let's play / live streams to your heart content, no need to ask for my permission: you got it.\n\nIf you like, post a comment here or on the¬†main forum thread to let's us know what fun stuff you are doing with the mods so we can all share in the fun.¬†\n¬†\nNo one is authorized to repost my mods, or any part of them, on any other website other then Curse Forge. If you wish, you can link to this page (or the Zero Core 2 one) from your website to let your users download the mod.\n\n\n## A NOTE ON SAFETY\n\nWe release our mods only on CurseForge, Modrinth or the FTB launcher and their respective websites:\n\nIf you found our mods on another website be sure that they do not come from us and we cannot guarantee that you are downloading something safe to use and that will work on your version of Minecraft. To keep things short: do not download those files and always use the CurseForge, Modrinth or the FTB launcher or their respective websites\n\n","published":"2022-11-18T17:48:49.314155Z","updated":"2023-10-15T15:17:27.715781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":91435,"followers":51,"categories":["technology","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["HnaPALbm","29cP26iq","q6eZgnW3","lXY8AQnu","qb93c55m","O76WSn3r","yk4Vc39G","2WVMMW6H","NfRN5BFW","xHyu5PeP","YAUrhKii","X49ifA8H","q1zYEzRt","NB4zEHJK","WYlgL8NK","qSp5oA64","xWhrtnGG","GEXjCRxl","rnzB7p2Y","lpEA1SCq","H8hwL9KY","OFI6WnhE","WjWzQcbH","tQHXTlmS","162lYZcb","JZOQJiht","ZaHjUOrO","1L7HJQWM","aWj4vg3e","lzg72TTO","xwLWlGec","lu5PWrmf","5CYl80HP"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/idkvShUy/48547286b3acecb37d1fe7e2befaa631c65f29af.png"},"version":{"id":"5CYl80HP","project_id":"idkvShUy","author_id":"aPljNITF","featured":true,"name":"1.20.1-2.0.75","version_number":"1.20.1-2.0.75","changelog":"- Fixed in-game book recipe\n- Bumped version to 2.0.75","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-15T15:17:29.271842Z","downloads":20349,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"6692cae13b74b27ccbb28f4ad792d2d87b5bf3a6c168d7a2f5d5e43aea9069fa7a5fa71b69346dc849986825883962f95460220b7fc1bc2fe468180520fe2ed8","sha1":"9ffe1bcb6174aa6f57e799d7865b9afa08453606"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/idkvShUy/versions/5CYl80HP/ExtremeReactors2-1.20.1-2.0.75.jar","filename":"ExtremeReactors2-1.20.1-2.0.75.jar","primary":true,"size":2338372,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"kR2IVnv0","project_id":"rHpb85Mf","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gp0ELhxH","user":{"id":"aPljNITF","username":"ZeroNoRyouki","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7107662?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-11-18T16:37:13.031737Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ExtremeReactors2-1.20.1-2.0.75.jar"},"mods\\shuffle-forge-9.0.0+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"c02f21ef920d036e07a2196222b3b72a2b2c6f53de588f1bd2c5839aceaff5bdd94818f32f8a138219ab01cb7b14f5f5936b6705a5a704cb58ef81f4c8c1dfdb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"WUvGZLgB","slug":"shuffle","project_type":"mod","team":"lVW1yqg9","title":"Shuffle","description":"Randomly place blocks from your hotbar","body":"Shuffle allows players to place blocks randomly from their hotbar.

Hovering over a certain percentage list will show the possible stacks you can expect to get at that probability.\n- Stack sizes shown represent the average item count you can expect to pull at a time (before factoring in the probability).\n- Block drops have been added. These views show the various drops available, split into different categories based on any particular circumstances needed to get that drop (Silk Touch, Shears, etc).\n- Mob drops have been added. Shows drops available split into categories based on circumstances needed to acquire them (only when a mob is on fire, extra with looting, etc)\n\n\n#### Features to come\n- Implement resource-pack driven system for defining custom conditions and how to parse them.\n- Add in fishing and other gameplay loot\n\n\n","published":"2022-09-25T22:13:18.112945Z","updated":"2024-07-08T16:18:17.891555Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":697896,"followers":243,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["g010jnKd","YvsiPoNW","sMYv0WU4","rEZyE6x3","hME9LTtZ","iiGhUAPe","UoqcWBE6","dsAxQzyr","R27L5Wrs","dDsA0q1m","AnKDZCEA","nkW4UzlO","OeVpkByV","byhOHBwi","pFHgMv8g","FzY7HsGk","WLrmskq7","TM0YFork","h5EhjjmQ","nH2jMxUZ","finLaORs","8VxvWtcW","b7JoJE05","p0Ugm9eu","odt1Mqrz","YZu0lWye","48q801AN","vWadFDyM","ge7Vbplt","9rpAPYB9","Xn48U1HI","Rp2bjZ9t","mPCfosCw","x6vIf3HD","tR4xqoxp","7rjmttb6","7fjkgVEh","GUbMMJRo","91c49w5V","95aOKine","O3uMSDN0","6rFgo1Px","lwhMjJHL","DnmJpY7Z","QmFv0252","F12qyiT2","htztuG2C","bStOmyQ8","l8uqaFoj","Och9ldiP","ZkDaJFMU","VhcPzhEp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/dec44ad1547e774b6fce97a5268f6ff6309ec40a.png"},"version":{"id":"ZkDaJFMU","project_id":"qbbO7Jns","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"EMI Loot 0.6.6+fix3+1.20.1+forge","version_number":"0.6.6+fix3+1.20.1+forge","changelog":"More fixes for the /reload issue","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-22T18:06:32.430645Z","downloads":3018,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"1320590d9c48e7d7bb67aa24c45bc7f6d73e950147679de7f4f3e4adadd48dd01a87c7e10c22652703930c942b567eaf6d17515c0c30703841a08279c20f8e30","sha1":"d0fbb7de06123b4bbc9e2558d27a4ccb2f6826fc"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qbbO7Jns/versions/ZkDaJFMU/emi_loot-0.6.6%2Bfix3%2B1.20.1%2Bforge.jar","filename":"emi_loot-0.6.6+fix3+1.20.1+forge.jar","primary":true,"size":360338,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ftdbN0KK","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"fRiHVvU7","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"fjpxz8db","username":"gayasslily","name":"Lily","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/fjpxz8db/8008d5d853889ec78ed06111577a56de684d0044.png","bio":"Creator of the modpack 'Lily's Vanilla OverQuilted'.\n\nI also make textures for stuff.","created":"2022-06-10T14:24:39.516887Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0},{"team_id":"A6CuhMKl","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"emi_loot-0.6.6+fix3+1.20.1+forge.jar"},"mods\\VisualWorkbench-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"fcfb713b7ce6b876243f294ffa154a203c6b9eced3c6dd978923413af9e737c0c220872b1a127d03c316da8b12e4bbae18a5ecf5f84ab57a2fb8548b41d8f0dc","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kfqD1JRw","slug":"visual-workbench","project_type":"mod","team":"r33eUgPo","title":"Visual Workbench","description":"Items stay inside of crafting tables and are also rendered on top.

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor.

Many modded crafting tables are supported by default, those that are not can be added to a custom config file found at <code>.minecraft/config/visual_workbench.json</code> (not accessible from in-game).

& Oculus Flywheel Compat","description":"Enable Flywheel's optimizations when using shaderpacks.","body":"## What's this?\n\n\n\nFlywheel will disable its optimizations when you are using shaderpacks.\n\nThis mod forces Flywheel's optimizations to be enabled.\n\nFor those using shaderpack and mods depend on Flywheel, this mod can significantly improve fps.\n\nIf you don't use shaderpack, this mod has no effect. Because Flywheel's optimizations are enabled by default.\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\n\n\nThe shaders that have been tested are:\n\n\n\nBSL\nComplementary\nComplementary Reimagined¬†\nSEUS renewed\nSildurs Vibrant Shaders\nAstraLex\n\nNew supported shaderpacks after 0.2.0:\n\n\n\nKapa 5.1\nNostalgia\nRethinking Voxels\nSEUS PTGI HRR\n\n\n\nThere are some shaderpacks that are also supported, but not listed above, so you can test them by yourself.\n\n\n\nThis mod only supports some specific versions of Iris or Oculus !!!\n\n\n\nIris&OculusFlwCompat   Iris or Oculus\n\n0.2.2 ---- >= 1.6.13\n\n0.2.1 ---- >= 1.6.5\n\n0.2.0 ---- >= 1.6.2\n\n0.1.9 ---- >= 1.5 and <= 1.6.1\n\n0.1.7~0.1.8 ---- >= 1.4 and < 1.5\n\n0.1.6 below ---- <1.4\n\n\n\n## Principle\n\nFlywheel uses a method called GPU Instancing to render entities. It is very efficient when rendering a large number of repeating entities (e.g. gears in Create mod). But when you use iris and enable shaderpack, this optimization is disabled. Because flywheel needs to use its own shader to render these entities and flywheel's shader will no longer work when you enable shaderpack.\n\n\n\nThis mod will automatically merge flywheel's shader with the shader in shaderpack when shaderpack is enabled to be able to render entities using Instancing.\n\n\n\nWhen you have a large number of entities to render, there is a huge CPU bottleneck with the original rendering method. This means that the better your GPU is, the bigger the FPS improvement from Flywheel.\n\n\n\n## How to use it?\n\n\n\n1. Install Flywheel(Create has embedded flywheel so you don't need to install it separately now) and Iris (Oculus if you use forge).\n\n2. Install this mod.\n\n","published":"2024-01-09T14:29:56.738699Z","updated":"2024-06-05T15:25:09.777196Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":151350,"followers":73,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["H1ouLgRR","5ocHQiCL","XfTsz2M5","BBYE8uFO","CH0C91Te","NoEldI7u","RCITAe7H","ce9TjaVw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ndHYMY2K/7d3794f7fdc4974ce4386bfc3e0ec27140a33de5.png"},"version":{"id":"RCITAe7H","project_id":"ndHYMY2K","author_id":"hEAeItIf","featured":true,"name":"Oculus Flywheel Compat 1.20.1-0.2.5 for Oculus 1.7 above","version_number":"oculus-1.20.1-0.2.5","changelog":"Compatibility with Oculus 1.7.0 and DistantHorizons.\n\nThanks [holmraven](https://github.com/leon-o/iris-flw-compat/pull/116).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-05T15:22:59.554810Z","downloads":9158,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c87704b10925302f8103a0323f868f93de436484","sha512":"a57510b5f06f492ef61570e62339cf062fcb103dba0df726810ffb53155ee1eea3144f33851d59efaa8695efc08ea90688e23454d25d27e348676993905bb801"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ndHYMY2K/versions/RCITAe7H/oculus-flywheel-compat-1.20.1-0.2.5.jar","filename":"oculus-flywheel-compat-1.20.1-0.2.5.jar","primary":true,"size":65177,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"GchcoXML","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"YrGnLWl3","user":{"id":"hEAeItIf","username":"leon-o","name":"Red Face","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/hEAeItIf/251111e97ba610a35ca3639a02ba7c0e5cb0a03f.jpg","bio":null,"created":"2024-01-09T14:28:28.295558Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"oculus-flywheel-compat-1.20.1-0.2.5.jar"},"mods\\ash_api-forge-3.0.2+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"861f413fd6806ba436375d83302facad39440436bafe44c0ae4f145c1dfcdd95ad9c346655ca9976f4743b7c8b8ff65c3364a67bb1e9a468263b7005a28a451c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"Q8xUICr6","slug":"ash-api","project_type":"mod","team":"ZNgEDwwD","title":"Ash API","description":"An abstraction layer between Fabric, Forge, and Quilt's APIs.","body":"An API that provides an abstraction layer between the three main Minecraft mod loaders (Fabric, Forge, and Quilt). \n\nIt is meant to be used with a multi-loader development environment such as Jared's [MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template).\n\n## Mods using Ash API\n- [Armor Visibility](https://modrinth.com/mod/armor-visibility)\n- [Flourish](https://modrinth.com/mod/flourish)\n- [Shuffle](https://modrinth.com/mod/shuffle)\n- [Transparent](https://modrinth.com/mod/transparent)\n\n## Implemented APIs\nFull documentation of all implemented APIs will be available soon.

Please post your questions here.\n\nThis port currently does not change any of the original optimizations. On code side the only differences are the following ones:\n\n*   I adapted the class references and mixin injection points to match it to SRG and Forge\n*   I removed one of the original embedded libraries by using the default mixin annotation classes\n*   I removed some compatibility modes for one mod that does not exist for Forge.\n\nThis port is fully compatible with Rubidium/Embeddium* and Oculus. It also should work with Optifine however it will be not officially supported by me.\n\n### **How it works**\n\nInstead of leaving just the outer layer of leaves, Cull Less Leaves also renders a certain amount of layers defined in the config.\n\n* Rubidium for 1.18.2-1.19.2\n* Embeddium starting from 1.20\n\n![comparison](https://i.imgur.com/gicGSgK.png)\n\nRubidium/Embeddium Configuration\n\n![rubidium config](https://i.imgur.com/UbWqA7b.png)","published":"2023-10-29T10:19:20.256396Z","updated":"2023-12-01T13:19:23.851339Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":182006,"followers":43,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["wkTY0aKT","prdzLnOo","wPOb8yEG"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qthuEuVy/1eaeef733aa1ad82a38c98c0790cb40f22ea6ef7.png"},"version":{"id":"wPOb8yEG","project_id":"qthuEuVy","author_id":"PiO0ZKEp","featured":false,"name":"Cull Less Leaves Reforged 1.20.1-1.0.5","version_number":"1.20.1-1.0.5","changelog":"update to 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-01T13:19:24.453871Z","downloads":126405,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"71b1603071461e036a3ba2aaeeb52cc10fa3d348","sha512":"1d037fd49a9b80eecf2ed8e3b64178d1fbae7cc2a511813ab8b627479713e79a98af0896366e1ad2a3fa3f9849eab086166c1a27227f6d9370c2738132d859e6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/qthuEuVy/versions/wPOb8yEG/CullLessLeaves-Reforged-1.20.1-1.0.5.jar","filename":"CullLessLeaves-Reforged-1.20.1-1.0.5.jar","primary":true,"size":22474,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"sk9rgfiA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"pYMej8BZ","user":{"id":"PiO0ZKEp","username":"CCr4ft3r","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118105353?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-02-26T13:49:54.011703Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"CullLessLeaves-Reforged-1.20.1-1.0.5.jar"},"mods\\cookingforblockheads-forge-1.20.1-16.0.6.jar":{"sha512":"15a826acfc0a41edaffe69cacd5d911909f70d98dac70c032ea54e11819bf55884ada15c8965313e950206831be07d6d26d857cc7cd1b153944c8dcc873b6e6f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"vJnhuDde","slug":"cooking-for-blockheads","project_type":"mod","team":"DtzWwJFD","title":"Cooking for Blockheads","description":"Adds a cooking book and multiblock kitchens that only shows recipes you can make with what you currently have in your inventory.","body":"![](https://blay09.net/files/brand/cookingforblockheads.png)\n\n[![](https://mods.twelveiterations.com/img/sponsor.png)](https://mods.twelveiterations.com/sponsor)\n\nThis mod adds a cooking book along with a functional kitchen to Minecraft.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## üêõ Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## üéÅ How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ‚ùì What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

\n\nAlex‚Äôs Caves is a Forge mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that adds 5 new cave biomes to the Overworld. Unlike most normal biomes, these cave biomes are exceedingly rare - yet they all contain a variety of unique blocks, items, mobs and mechanics that makes them considerable subterranean destinations. These five biomes are the Magnetic Caves, the Primordial Caves, the Toxic Caves, the Abyssal Chasm and the Forlorn Hollows. \n\n \n\nTo find any of these cave biomes, you‚Äôll need to discover an Underground Cabin anywhere in the overworld. From there, you will find loot barrels with cave tablets and a Cave Compendium - a guide book for Alex‚Äôs Caves that should provide you with all the knowledge needed to find and explore any biome added by the mod. For more information on getting started, see the ‚Äò[Getting Started](https://alexscaves.wiki.gg/wiki/Guides/Getting_Started)‚Äô section on the mod‚Äôs wiki.\n\n \n\nAlex‚Äôs Caves is a very large mod with a great deal of effort put into the look and feel of each new biome. Each biome added may have its own ambient particles, fog, brightness, light color and more. Because of this, it is recommended to experience this mod without shaders, since many shaders can alter or worsen the unique appearance of several of the biomes. The mod also has built-in compatibility with Just Enough Items and Alex‚Äôs Mobs.\n\n \n\nAny additional questions can be answered on the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/alexsmods), and bugs can be reported on [Github](https://github.com/AlexModGuy/AlexsCaves).\n\n \n\n### Credits:\n\n#### Creators:\n- Alexthe668: programmer and co-creator\n- Noonyeyz: artist and co-creator\n\n#### Sound Team:\n- PrismaticPinky: sound design\n- LudoCrypt: musician\n- Gatetoh: musician and sound design\n- Arby698: sound design\n- RenRen: musician\n- _Ninni: sound design\n\n#### Documentation Team:\n - HolidayRaptor: documentation\n- PlummetStudios: documentation\n","published":"2023-11-04T17:47:20.616416Z","updated":"2024-03-06T17:29:17.761970Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":251226,"followers":588,"categories":["adventure","mobs","worldgen"],"additional_categories":["equipment","food","game-mechanics","magic","technology","transportation"],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["VOMqwoQ3","JnyjMWKA","zUdjxO9k","gCvzvSsJ","e7H7vKvS","SLvvjh2O","RplA7oyA","3yOJpMFg","pdifL7d0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U6GY0xp0/4165eef78a7efa0f5acda964dd094c08ee0e5680.png"},"version":{"id":"pdifL7d0","project_id":"U6GY0xp0","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Alex's Caves 1.1.4","version_number":"1.1.4","changelog":"-Slightly increased volcano generation distance\n\n-Added tag to exclude entities from being spawned from amber monoliths\n\n-Fixed magnetron only being made out of stone\n\n-Fixed gammaroaches being hostile to cows\n\n-Fixed giant bat holograms\n\n-Fixed missing luxtructosaurus sound console spam\n\n-Fixed endermen spawning in abyssal chasms\n\n-Fixed atlatitan making too many stomping noises at once\n\n-Fixed vallumraptors eating their own eggs\n\n-Fixed deep ones spinning whilst trading\n\n-Fixed abyssal altar not having a take item animation\n\n-Fixed primal magma not being avoided by mobs\n\n-Fixed grottoceratops forgetting its target occasionally\n\n-Fixed cooked tripodfish being eaten very fast\n\n-Fixed crash with notors scanning cobblemon entities\n\n-Fixed sated blade enchantment not increasing saturation level\n\n-Fixed hullbreakers getting crowded out of spawnpools by other mods\n\n-Updated toka pona translations\n\n-Updated chinese translations","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-06T17:29:21.111667Z","downloads":141256,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a84b72fed62fde027a06cc086531b923726729ea14e1f04c9fa20898b5667d332eb1fa24d93e346a0990b4cfdad78ead6e7e265ba61a96dae5dcae7ea9f415d4","sha1":"3899837681e024ab4d520301346980fe51eceffa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/U6GY0xp0/versions/pdifL7d0/alexscaves-1.1.4.jar","filename":"alexscaves-1.1.4.jar","primary":true,"size":61508689,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"jJfV67b1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ri6vA5Gk","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"ri6vA5Gk","user":{"id":"KJbDpjKi","username":"Noonyeyz","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42457241?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-05-06T12:46:00.258719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Artist","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"alexscaves-1.1.4.jar"},"mods\\ExtremeSoundMuffler-3.48-forge-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"d28750837e22964366e60645673d9980e8f05a42cfda2a773a883454e51ace4a2d133ab4a54248ed0236853bfe0fead7e916ce9fd1cc680e7fa43f94be9b1cbd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5IIKsxiL","slug":"extreme_sound_muffler","project_type":"mod","team":"EWpnVYOK","title":"Extreme sound muffler","description":"Extreme sound muffler is a client side mod that allows you to muffle sounds selectively.","body":"<h1><center> Extreme sound muffler</center></h1>\n<br/>\n<h3><center> Extreme sound muffler is a client side mod that allows you to muffle sounds selectively. </center></h3> \n<br/>\n<h6><center><b>Now with Dark mode!! check the configs to enable it!</b></center></h6>\n\n<h5><center><b>This Mod works on <a href= https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge alt=\"FORGE\"> FORGE</a> and <a href= https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/ alt=\"FABRIC\"> FABRIC</a>.</b></center></h5>\n\n## HOW IT WORKS:\n\n    1.

Tweaks","description":"Enhances inventory management by adding various functions to the mouse buttons. ","body":"Mouse Tweaks replaces the standard RMB dragging mechanic, adds two new LMB dragging mechanics and an ability to quickly move items with the scroll wheel.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install a compatible mod loader:\n    - 1.16.5 and later: install Minecraft Forge or Fabric.\n    - 1.14.4 and later: install Minecraft Forge.\n    - 1.12.2 and earlier: install either Minecraft Forge or LiteLoader (or both).\n2. Put the Mouse Tweaks jar-file into the mods folder in your .minecraft directory.\n\nMouse Tweaks is purely client-side. There is no server-side component.\n\n### Extras\n\n[**Mouse Tweaks API**](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/tree/master/src/main/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api)\n\nConfiguration file: `.minecraft/config/MouseTweaks.cfg`\n\n## Tweaks\n\n### RMB Tweak\n\nVery similar to the standard RMB dragging mechanic, with one difference: if you drag over a slot multiple times, an item will be put there multiple times. Replaces the standard mechanic if enabled.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `RMBTweak=1`\n\nHold your right mouse button:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uo7xF.png)\n\nDrag your mouse around the crafting grid:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NCRED.png)\n\nYou can drag your mouse on top of existing items:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6MQv6.png)\n\n### LMB Tweak (with item)\n\nLets you quickly pick up or move items of the same type.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithItem=1`\n\nHold your left mouse button to pick up an item:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ziuGG.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items of the same type will be picked up:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDjsE.png?2)\n\nHold shift and drag. Items of the same type will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YrvmT.png?2)\n\n### LMB Tweak (without item)\n\nQuickly move items into another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `LMBTweakWithoutItem=1`\n\nHold shift, then hold your left mouse button:\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f9Ejp.png?1)\n\nDrag your mouse across the inventory. Items will get \"shift-clicked\":\n\n*(Mouse cursor is not visible for some reason)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qBu6k.png?2)\n\n### Wheel Tweak\n\nScroll to quickly move items between inventories. When you scroll down on an item stack, its items will be moved one by one. When you scroll up, items will be moved into it from another inventory.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelTweak=1`\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelSearchOrder=1`\n\nWhen you scroll up, the mod will search for items from last to first (when this is set to 1) or from first to last (when this is set to 0).\n\n**Configuration setting:** `WheelScrollDirection=0`\n\nSet this to 1 to invert the default scroll actions. So, when set to 1, scrolling down will pull the items and scrolling up will push the items.\n\nSet this to 2 to enable the inventory position aware scrolling. Scrolling up will push the items into the other inventory if it's above the selected slot, or pull items from the other inventory if it's below the selected slot. Vice versa for scrolling down.\n\n### Obsolete / Removed Settings\n\nThese settings existed in older Mouse Tweaks versions but were removed since.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `OnTickMethodOrder=Forge, LiteLoader`\n\nMouse Tweaks can use multiple APIs for an OnTick method that it requires. You can use this setting to control the API it prefers. This shouldn't really matter at all. If a method isn't supported (for example, you don't have the API installed) the mod will proceed to check the next ones.\n\n**Configuration setting:** `ScrollHandling=0`\n\nToggles between \"smooth scrolling, minor issues\" (0) and \"non-smooth scrolling, no issues\" (1). When set to smooth scrolling, minor issues may be experienced such as scrolling \"through\" JEI or other mods. When set to non-smooth scrolling, those issues will not happen, but the scrolling will be a little non-smooth. Non-smooth scrolling works only with the Forge OnTick method.\n\nThis option is set to smooth scrolling by default because the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nMouse Tweaks is compatible with everything based on `GuiContainer` (as long as the behavior isn't changed too much).\n\nIf your GUI isn't based on `GuiContainer`, or if you want to improve compatibility (making Mouse Tweaks ignore some slot, for example), take a look at the [API documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/blob/2dc5bb108c2663f9a07b3a181483733a0274b41a/src/api/java/yalter/mousetweaks/api/IMTModGuiContainer3.java).\n\n## Modpacks\n\nFeel free to include Mouse Tweaks in modpacks.\n","published":"2021-03-20T15:55:49.895120Z","updated":"2024-06-17T08:24:45.317893Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2342682,"followers":2057,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","modloader","neoforge"],"versions":["RNWLd5dh","VmXwwpoa","ZP9EDGxB","7F7mEY80","Q3YILuAe","EGSuwm1J","q0CGibTg","ILp7UQip","475fj6e8","NanXuqPE","pmMCbsN3","Un7oJEL8","kyT0ersE","Aax1dmTi","5EvmIoqj","dXBVA16v","sjDYaHEo","stb5nE30","m0Dd8Cjy","jBovYAZR","LABx1dmK","mjuG4AYd","LG14xw1O","7nm8NrSL","1n3YehcE","nWbxhour","7JVXOe3K","GUHZDxpy","9IcJV4UJ","dUVBjrNs","ylmBQ38A"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"7JVXOe3K","project_id":"aC3cM3Vq","author_id":"On32SQVu","featured":false,"name":"[1.20.1 Forge] Mouse Tweaks 2.25.1","version_number":"1.20.1-2.25.1-forge","changelog":"- Fixed an incompatibility with certain mods that was causing a crash (specifically, Nether Chested was triggering this Mouse Tweaks issue).\n- Improved compatibility with slots with custom stack limits (like in the Nether Chested mod).","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-12T16:27:50.280746Z","downloads":93217,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d751153e722a4e014691c83f39f5b07c6ec5333c","sha512":"a3bb0272c0a1a3be9250dfee030bb8f86217fa6a32bd534be8c940fdd8c466c800c2df85874877983ced36ecfc28c8ced6c0d42107c1ab621385b4be9a7c65eb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/7JVXOe3K/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1.jar","primary":true,"size":76237,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"abfc1f2e2112efd147cd092122287d3d5a59e35d","sha512":"98916c93bed3ca456c6f0de0f5b52a40a70f88c2d308414e02eb18fee3aeaefe2437fe3fc3cc29bc78a4d06258d158836e85216a7f2c66a838d2ff1b89853abe"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/7JVXOe3K/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1-api.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1-api.jar","primary":false,"size":1995,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"946f3003fbf087ad5a0361a317afb2bda73b69ce","sha512":"2f641413fc64371853e1ca07243348de5759d8e30f419347af8c2edc556c010297d8f45f088d4a394f0b5494bd951412c0b9d9dce2eaa29bd5bb0fdf97ac6acd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/aC3cM3Vq/versions/7JVXOe3K/MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1-src.jar","filename":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1-src.jar","primary":false,"size":19734,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Gn6mAc1d","user":{"id":"On32SQVu","username":"YaLTeR","name":"Ivan Molodetskikh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1794388?v=4","bio":"","created":"2021-03-20T15:35:29.504966Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"MouseTweaks-forge-mc1.20.1-2.25.1.jar"},"mods\\beautify-2.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"e1484165b14dd71473c6934647a71e62db3a281cbaaa66ef7eaf4f5325e9807820954156354fc92626c65f1dc17b7e9be4649c1ef6191b83b27bf749af0f302f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"9BPuv4vL","slug":"beautify","project_type":"mod","team":"HyW8QXDQ","title":"Beautify!","description":"Adds lots of vanilla-styled ways to spice up your builds.","body":"![](https://i.imgur.com/tDSBihU.jpg) ![](https://i.imgur.com/aVn4B6m.gif)\n\n## What is Beautify?\n\n### Beautify is a **client and serverside deco-mod** that¬†adds lots of **vanilla-styled** ways to spice up your builds with custom models.\n\nMy goal with this mod is to **increase the detail** in builds **without killing the need for imagination and creativity**.\nAdditionally, most blocks include **new features**.

tracker](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Mekanistics/issues/). Join the [AE2 discord server](https://discord.gg/Zd6t9ka7ne) for discussion.\n\nThis is a Forge mod for 1.18.2 which requires both AE2 and Mekanism.\n\n## Chemical support\nApplied Mekanistics adds chemical support to existing AE2 devices. For example, this means that you can put an import bus on a chemical tank, export bus on a chemical tank, storage bus on a radioactive waste barrel, attach pressurized tubes to interfaces or use chemicals in crafting recipes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hTShq45.png)\n\n## Chemical cells\nApplied Mekanistics also adds 1k, 4k, 16k and 64k chemical storage cells. You can now store gasses in your ME Drives! Do however note that they don't support radioactive gasses!\n\n## Chemical P2P tunnels\nApplied Mekanistics adds Chemical P2P Tunnels for high-throughput chemical transfer. Simply right click any Mekanism chemical tank on a P2P tunnel to convert it.\n\n## QIO support for Storage Bus\nApplied Mekanistics also allows the Storage Bus to interact with the contents of a QIO frequency. Just place the storage bus on the side of a QIO Dashboard.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EMxQdXR.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sif07Mx.png)\n\n## Recipes\n\nTo create a chemical housing, you'll need to use Osmium ingots instead of Iron or Copper ingots\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wXzGjtU.png)\n\nThe housing can be combined with a cell component to craft a storage cell\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7J3EU7l.png)","published":"2022-06-25T21:48:12.557632Z","updated":"2024-04-27T00:37:58.590463Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":32899,"followers":38,"categories":["storage","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["sGOs3fJx","b9XlfAwn","iYZmHmKf","zPUceDl0","7agSGPsS","EX7BxaHP","1mwC2ZzC","r0mdRXIa","TbjiRSjd","d9GM663Q","Wbz5eyMw","wGlxD9Bs","BG93ZC9u","i4WJI0gp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IiATswDj/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"d9GM663Q","project_id":"IiATswDj","author_id":"z0r5biKh","featured":false,"name":"1.4.2","version_number":"1.4.2","changelog":"View changelog at [the release page](https://github.com/AppliedEnergistics/Applied-Mekanistics/releases/tag/1.4.2)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-05T11:43:48.374553Z","downloads":15608,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"1c6742e3ac2662844c720a42728a10bb9648d13b","sha512":"ea5ce898888da123405a676fe1dc0a6a15e0eb5cfa1cc8bcda50de50e559ff92434c391e88c6bf5bc8c46e864518ae4ebdade8da47fe1f48b5c77135d0f6052e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/IiATswDj/versions/d9GM663Q/Applied-Mekanistics-1.4.2.jar","filename":"Applied-Mekanistics-1.4.2.jar","primary":true,"size":178447,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ce6I4WUE","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"XxWD5pD3","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"RNvAjQYw","user":{"id":"z0r5biKh","username":"ramidzkh","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/19631324?v=4","bio":"I write dumb mods","created":"2020-10-27T20:06:42.423613Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Applied-Mekanistics-1.4.2.jar"},"mods\\mcw-trapdoors-1.1.3-mc1.20.1forge.jar":{"sha512":"d84d90eb5b9bb8641fd8cf82a8d8491c7253bfc17d8ffa9bb14e5bb73f3d2921d3afe6f042599ed88662d9cbbe0b20de450ad5d9f2e7deefe1597471a7191beb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"n2fvCDlM","slug":"macaws-trapdoors","project_type":"mod","team":"skWgO2J2","title":"Macaw's Trapdoors","description":"Adds vanila trapdoors in every plank variation, and some new trapdoors too!","body":"![Banner image](https://i.imgur.com/5soWQJH.png)\n\n[![YouTube](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCc_kqzt253fnG2RHW_CZL2A?label=Youtube&style=for-the-badge)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc_kqzt253fnG2RHW_CZL2A)[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20-ffffff)![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/sketch_macaw?color=6eb7ec&label=Twitter&logo=twitter&style=for-the-badge)![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20-ffffff)](https://twitter.com/sketch_macaw)[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/645360921673465857?color=a97db2&logo=discord&logoColor=f&style=for-the-badge)](https://discord.gg/RFQqDEb)[![Crafting Recipes](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Crafting%20Recipes-bc8f56?style=for-the-badge)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dBcTfrt-MH91NuCmJzqbFDjrLftuKMc08fp4bjGJCD4/edit#gid=472963468)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GUtHhCc.png)\n\n![About](https://i.imgur.com/A1pclRa.png)\n\nHave you ever thought, how great would it be, when Minecraft had the basic vanila trapdoors in each plank variation?\n\nIf so then you have come to the right place!

The banner pattern will encompass the entire bed, so the color of the bed doesn't really matter as much as the color of the banner when they're combined.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/TYrYYjbM/bedshot.png)\n\nIn addition, players can separate them again by crafting the decorated bed by itself. This will yield the original banner used and will leave the original bed used in the crafting grid.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","published":"2023-02-04T05:41:26.071759Z","updated":"2023-06-20T00:28:50.121597Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":196063,"followers":158,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["mcoSrF6h","JEAu6khH","aNdOjuSs","CrczLlPE","rtFZR8Rp","Lf1ARiGN","uYyKN0NP","5lxejnHs","SiEyMylD","tkIEPqFf","nFsnpwRv","5X7yabn5","Hs1l72bI","sS7oUbUV","7cDvkd96","16t0eTJl","1RAVviYw","i9nYMUAq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vNNL5mc7/ad8c5bcc846d892dda3388d548e928d0ff590ee0.png"},"version":{"id":"16t0eTJl","project_id":"vNNL5mc7","author_id":"zbpHS3ry","featured":false,"name":"bedspreads-forge-6.2.0+1.20.1","version_number":"6.2.0+1.20.1","changelog":"The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\nThis is a copy of the changelog for the most recent version.

They are not simply pests and menaces, but the main cause of the loss of many lives. Only a brave few can slay a dragon. Even less can tame one.**\n\n**Welcome, to Ice and Fire.**\n\nIce and Fire is a mod created by both Raptorfarian and Alexthe666, which hopes to add dragons in a proper way. Currently, Dragons have two types: Ice and Fire. Fire Dragons breathe fire and roam most of the habitable world, whilst Ice Dragons inhabit the coldest places known to man and freeze their prey to death. Both kinds of dragons spawn naturally as adults. And news has reached us of a new discovery: Lightning dragons, powerful nocturnal creatures that deal blasting bolts of lighting to kill their prey.\n\n \n\nIn 1.2.0, Hippogryphs, Gorgons, and Pixies have been added.\n\nIn 1.3.0, Dragons were redone and Cyclopes have been added.\n\nIn 1.4.0, Sirens, Hippocampi, and Death worms have been added.\n\nIn 1.5.0, Cockatrices, Stymphalian Birds, and Trolls have been added.\n\nIn 1.6.0, Myrmex have been added.\n\nIn 1.7.0, Amphitheres and Sea Serpents have been added.\n\nIn 1.8.0, Dragons were redone and support was added for many other mods.\n\nIn 1.9.0, Dread Liches and Hydras have been added.\n\nIn 2.0.0, Lightning dragons have been added.\n\nIn 2.1.0, Ghosts have been added.\n\n\nWe plan on including additional mythical creatures. For further details check out our [discord](https://discord.gg/DAzxNagMHA) (for more up to date previews)\n\n\nIce and Fire aims to bring to you a revolutionary dragon experience.\nWe allow role players and mod pack makers to have access to all\nthe basic and advanced needs of a dragon hunter and tamer role. These\ninclude:\n\nDragon skeletons - these can be found in desert biomes and can be used to collect a few bones\n\nDragon roosts and caverns - where you can fight dragons and find grand treasures\n\nDragon eggs - which can be found in dragon caves\n\nDragon taming and riding - mount up your tamed dragons and even armour them\n\nDragon equipment - craft tools and weapons from dragon bones and armours from dragon scales\n\nBestiary - for collecting and learning information with regards to dragons\nIn additional updates we will invest time in other mythical monsters and creatures.\n\n\nIce and Fire also provides custom support for the following other mods:\n\n- Just Enough Items (JEI)\n- TheOneProbe\n- HWYLA\n- Thaumcraft\n- CraftTweaker(see the documentation here)\n- Tinker's Construct\n","published":"2023-11-04T19:46:13.838209Z","updated":"2024-02-20T03:27:38.691247Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":267918,"followers":344,"categories":["adventure","magic","mobs"],"additional_categories":["equipment","worldgen"],"game_versions":["1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.15.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["VxyE62t8","jahXVl7B","737XMmok","lqOUIWIA","hk9Ds2Ek","exnVQUJF","kLgo7C5F","EkpdpGA3","lImFfKwi","mClFdBsp","P5RF8zCb","5f9S3HF9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LVnvHVBp/7f4900581f5f2e1108829fa45e54331eb91dace1.png"},"version":{"id":"5f9S3HF9","project_id":"LVnvHVBp","author_id":"iBpwljlP","featured":false,"name":"Ice and Fire 2.1.13-1.20.1-beta-4","version_number":"2.1.13-1.20.1-beta-4","changelog":"-fixed crash on server startup","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-20T03:27:40.223613Z","downloads":100994,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"38a3a731a90713e3744385d7a44524e11378dac0","sha512":"1173744cb76f44f2854670491b9367df185ef29adad698cd8d512cec68f1ac3fc79ec54169eb93c3d6cd317f973336c3e29a27c7b5dea2dd050098ff77a8b840"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LVnvHVBp/versions/5f9S3HF9/iceandfire-2.1.13-1.20.1-beta-4.jar","filename":"iceandfire-2.1.13-1.20.1-beta-4.jar","primary":true,"size":21767038,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"jJfV67b1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"DFgMc5Zf","user":{"id":"iBpwljlP","username":"AlexModGuy","name":"AlexModGuy","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/iBpwljlP/921ad78a793efff6d03b582fa3dc1f06bb237426.jpeg","bio":"aka Alex Mobiles, Alexander Caverns, Alexthe668\n\nhttps://github.com/AlexModGuy","created":"2023-11-03T16:23:16.718366Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"DFgMc5Zf","user":{"id":"6wxQvqVD","username":"TheBv","name":"Patrick Schrottenbacher","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/6wxQvqVD/5346030452fea3d12e03ae73a79205acb460ee81.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-11-07T01:44:36.837472Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Contributor","ordering":0},{"team_id":"DFgMc5Zf","user":{"id":"GVwMfxH6","username":"ron0","name":"ron0","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/GVwMfxH6/8719971078b3e21810436fb51a509bc13bc4c2dd.png","bio":null,"created":"2023-11-03T08:09:59.955250Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"iceandfire-2.1.13-1.20.1-beta-4.jar"},"mods\\Jade-1.20.1-forge-11.9.4.jar":{"sha512":"94e27580ebc0dd4ee186b200a0c07582a828b4c125728308256c7182ca3fd24363c6214029508e510f1698dd5ef3685efa2640bbe0ec21764548b58b022cf072","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"nvQzSEkH","slug":"jade","project_type":"mod","team":"UadxHcYS","title":"Jade üîç","description":"Shows information about what you are looking at.

Because the Jumbo Furnace can smelt multiple recipes at a time, it has a fixed cooking cycle time for all jumbo smelting recipes (specified in your world folder's serverconfig/jumbofurnace-server.toml file). Vanilla smelting recipes with higher cooking times than jumbo furnace's cycle time cannot be smelted in the jumbo furnace.\n\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/KXQSDZIy/images/4ea84f718fb3919e7450df2e596b9b2a33b8baa3.png)\n\nThe Jumbo Furnace is fully compatible with hoppers and other item handlers; the top faces access the input inventory, the side faces access the fuel inventory, and the bottom faces access the output inventory.\n\n![](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/KXQSDZIy/images/2d6388f445c3b618e1402cd2d464ef5909e59aef.png)\n\nThe Jumbo Furnace supports recipes that require up to nine ingredients. The Jumbo Furnace supports the standard ingredient types added by Minecraft and by Forge, and should generally work with json ingredient types added by other mods. These recipes can be defined in json by using the \"jumbofurnace:jumbo_smelting\" recipe type. An example of a jumbo smelting recipe:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"type\": \"jumbofurnace:jumbo_smelting\",\n\t\"ingredients\":\n\t[\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"type\": \"forge:nbt\",\n\t\t\t\"item\": \"minecraft:furnace\",\n\t\t\t\"count\": 27\n\t\t}\n\t],\n\t\"result\":\n\t{\n\t\t\"item\": \"jumbofurnace:jumbo_furnace\"\n\t},\n\t\"experience\": 0.1\n}\n```","published":"2023-07-22T23:00:48.458962Z","updated":"2023-08-06T16:30:51.014137Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1140,"followers":10,"categories":["game-mechanics","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["8O1svXZk","Pgkbq4cZ","Dg4hXqSE"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/KXQSDZIy/3245abc5c9d22daf7b0b2c922cff74b1678f511d.png"},"version":{"id":"Dg4hXqSE","project_id":"KXQSDZIy","author_id":"K9YRVHJ0","featured":false,"name":"Jumbo Furnace 4.0.0.5","version_number":"4.0.0.5","changelog":"## 1.20.1-4.0.0.5\n* Fix \"unknown recipe category\" log warnings for jumbo smelting recipes\n\n## 1.20.1-4.0.0.4\n* Fix jumbo furnace creating the wrong number of output items\n\n## 1.20.1-4.0.0.3\n* Jumbo Furnace now stops furnacing when it runs out of output space\n\n## 1.20.1-4.0.0.2\n* Fix slot offsets in JEI\n\n## 1.20.1-4.0.0.1\n* Fix broken textures in JEI recipe viewer for jumbo smelting\n\n## 1.20.1-4.0.0.0\n* Updated Jumbo Furnace to Minecraft 1.20.1 (requires forge 47.0.3 or higher)\n\n## 1.19.2-3.0.0.0\n* Updated Jumbo Furnace to Minecraft 1.19.2 (requires forge 43.1.0 or higher)\n* This is a save-compatibility-breaking update.

container to make it look like the fluid in the container (1.19+).\n- Right click the block with Glowstone Dust to make it produce light.\n- Right click the block with a Framed Hammer to remove the camo.\n- Right click the block with an empty fluid container to remove a fluid camo (1.19+).\n\n### Special behaviors\n\n- Framed Prism, Inner Prism and Double Prism Corners automatically activate a texture offset depending on their position when placed. This fixes the issue of prism corners not fitting together properly when building a larger surface out of these blocks. If this behaviour is not desired, you can toggle the offset state by left clicking the block with the Framed Hammer.\n\n- The Framed Wrench (and any other item in the \"forge:tools/wrench\" tag) can be used to rotate the Framed Block. On most blocks, the rotation behaviour is dependent on the face that was clicked.\n\n- The Framed Screwdriver can be used to cycle through different states of the camo block.\n\n- The Framed Blueprint allows copying Framed Blocks including their camo and glowing state. The rotation of the Framed Block itself is not copied.\n\n- The Framed Collapsible Block can be modified to create arbitrary slopes by changing the height of the four corners of a single block face with the Framed Hammer. Left click the corner on the face you want to change to move the face inward and left click the corner while sneaking to move the face outward. This modification can only happen on a single face at once and only within the bounds of a full block. If the four corners are displaced in a way that they can't form a plane, the visual result might be unexpected. This is a result of the inner workings of OpenGL and not a bug in the mod! The direction of the line separating the two triangles can be toggled by left-clicking the block with a Framed Wrench\n\n- When activated in the server config, most blocks can be right-clicked with a Phantom Membrane (can be changed in the server config) to make them intangible, allowing you to move through them. To remove this, right click the block with a Framed Screwdriver while crouching.\n\n- The latch of the Framed Chest can be switched between three modes by left clicking the chest with a Framed Hammer:\n  - Default chest latch (default state)\n  - Camo-textured latch\n  - No latch\n\n- The Framed Key allows locking certain Framed Blocks in their current shape to suppress neighbor updates. This allows placing blocks in configurations that would not be possible with the desired neighbors (i.e. placing Framed Stairs in the corner shape without keeping the necessary neighbors to force that shape).\n\n- The Framed Pressure Plates (all variants) can be switched between waterloggable and non-waterloggable by left-clicking them with a Framed Hammer. Their default state is non-waterloggable to match vanilla behaviour.\n\n### Important notes\n\nMake sure to enable the `experimentalForgeLightPipelineEnabled` setting in the `forge-client.toml` config file to get proper lighting on all shapes.\n\n# Configuration\n\nFramedBlocks offers a few configuration options to tweak certain behaviour. Listed below are the main ones relevant to players\n\n<details>\n<summary>Common</summary>\n\n- `fireproofBlocks`: Makes Framed Blocks completely fireproof by disabling dynamic flammability (default: false)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Client</summary>\n\n- `showGhostBlocks`: Shows a half transparent placement aid when a Framed Block is held (default: true)\n- `fancyHitboxes`: Draw custom hitboxes on blocks like the slope instead of their actual stair step collision box (default: true)\n- `detailedCulling`: Hides faces between Framed Blocks if applicable even if the face doesn't fill the whole block face (default: true)\n- `conTexMode`: Configures to what degree connected textures are supported on framed blocks (default: `FULL_FACE`)\n  - `NONE`: Disables connected textures support\n  - `FULL_FACE`: Enables connected textures on full faces located at the outer bounds of the block volume\n  - `FULL_EDGE`: Enables connected textures as above and on edges spanning the full block width on non-full faces located at the outer bounds of the block volume\n  - `DETAILED`: Enables connected textures support as above and on most faces next to other framed blocks\n- `overlay` category: Configure to which degree overlays for certain special interactions are shown (default: `DETAILED`)\n  - `HIDDEN`: Hides the overlay\n  - `ICON`: Only shows the icon of the overlay next to the crosshair\n  - `DETAILED`: Shows the icon and a description\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Server</summary>\n\n- `allowBlockEntities`: Whether blocks with BlockEntities can be placed in Framed Blocks (default: false)\n  - Note: placing BlockEntities in Framed Blocks may in rare cases lead to crashes. To fix a crashing block, either disable this config setting or add the offending block to the blacklist tag, the camo(s) conflicting with either change will then be removed when the block is loaded\n- `enableIntangibleFeature`: Enables the intangibility feature. Disabling this also prevents moving through blocks that are already marked as intangible (default: false)\n- `intangibleMarkerItem`: The item to use for making Framed Blocks intangible. The value must be a valid item registry name (default: `minecraft:phantom_membrane`)\n- `oneWayWindowOwnable`: Whether changing the see-through face is limited to the player who placed the One-Way Window (default: true)\n- `consumeCamoItem`: Whether applying a camo consumes the item and removing it drops the item again (default: true\n\n</details>\n\n# Datapack Features\n\n- If a block cannot be placed in a Framed Block and you think that it should be, you can add the block to the `framedblocks:frameable` tag via a datapack. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/XFactHD/FramedBlocks/blob/1.16.x/src/generated/resources/data/framedblocks/tags/blocks/frameable.json).\n- If a block can be placed in a Framed Block and you think that it shouldn't be, you can add the block to the `framedblocks:blacklisted` tag via a datapack. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/XFactHD/FramedBlocks/blob/1.16.x/src/generated/resources/data/framedblocks/tags/blocks/blacklisted.json).\n- All blocks in the `framedblocks:camo_sustain_plant` tag allow plants placeable on them to be placed on the respective solid faces of a framed block holding this block as camo. See the [builtin tag](https://github.com/XFactHD/FramedBlocks/blob/1.19.x/src/generated/resources/data/framedblocks/tags/blocks/camo_sustain_plant.json) for the default values.\n\n# Known issues\n\n- Mitigations for crashes with OptiFine break the rendering of the Framed Chest lid. When OptiFine is installed, the lid will not move when opening the chest","published":"2023-12-18T23:35:58.275548Z","updated":"2024-07-03T19:31:25.226850Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":65172,"followers":57,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1","1.21"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["Df87ktRk","6mUloCsT","6MJCf25K","sS9dmnKM","GcWaKzxZ","UpX1WkNE","D5XMHx9I","IckN6dEs","gHIdHCuD","elYMASQf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wbgfS34j/9e1c5293570d9822e51b99a385e25835f2ee6b1d.png"},"version":{"id":"IckN6dEs","project_id":"wbgfS34j","author_id":"u5G4xIK5","featured":false,"name":"FramedBlocks

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very

to ease developing multiplatform mods.\n\n### What is Architectury API\n\nArchitectury API is an api to abstract calls to fabric api and forge api as both loader has different implementations of\nwhat can be perceived as the same thing.\n\nArchitectury API updates regularly, with new hooks and features. Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform

Delight","description":"A cozy expansion to farming and cooking!","body":"<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wqSocVR.png\">\n</p>\n\nFarmer's Delight is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of **hearty meals**: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, brand new **tools and weapons** to hunt and gather with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the Advancements!** They explain many of the basic concepts, and are a good place to start from.\n\nPick up any item, then press the **L** key (by default) to open the Advancements screen. Or if you prefer a more direct guide, [click here!](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight is currently being updated for 1.18.2 and 1.19+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No, this mod will never be backported to older versions. The game's older codebases are entirely different, and usually missing important features this mod depends on.\n**Please do NOT ask for backports!**\n\n**Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?**\n\nA. Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)","published":"2022-08-07T23:18:53.898484Z","updated":"2024-01-22T02:29:38.409339Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":821208,"followers":890,"categories":["decoration","equipment","food"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"],"versions":["kwef5VB1","jc4l8jNt","jhP9p06T","huqohPcW","yE9Uj2ud","vKnBI3zc","uRQmgrHj","N1aLfuNT","p5bkNiw0","9N99D1CJ","tKCwnbTN","umpztmTl","k7RoRFPF","rFTKVUtq","AxgOboGq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/8e7aa38ab94d94bb0a2894a218b69beb49002b34.png"},"version":{"id":"AxgOboGq","project_id":"R2OftAxM","author_id":"btHGOarG","featured":true,"name":"Farmer's Delight 1.2.4 - 1.20.1","version_number":"1.20.1-1.2.4","changelog":"## 1.2.4\n\n### Updates\n- The Cooking Pot item now displays more information than before:\n  - A blue bar will be shown to indicate the amount of meal servings stored, similar to how Bundles display their fullness;\n  - The tooltip will display the stored food's item sprite alongside its name;\n- When viewing basic crops in JEI, they will display info on where they can be found as Wild Crops.\n\n### Fixes\n- (1.20) Creative Tab registration has been moved to server-side, so that other mods can access them for game logic;\n- Structure files for compost heaps are now format-updated with datagen, thus avoiding excessive DFU triggers on world gen. This should improve performance!\n  - Credit to malte0811, co-author of Immersive Engineering, for the StructureUpdater implementation;\n- Skillet's higher knockback is now implemented as an attribute, rather than an event, fixing a bug where the other hand's item also received this boost;\n- Skillet sounds now play at the correct stage of the damage cycle. This is noticeable on multiplayer, with some amount of latency;\n\n### Translations\n- Added a line for the Rotten Tomato entity in most langs (thanks, leagris!);\n- Added:\n  - sv_SE (thanks, Bjorkan!);\n- Updated:\n  - es_MX (thanks, CerealConJugo!);\n  - fr_FR (thanks, leagris!);\n  - ja_JP (thanks, EndilCrafter!)\n  - ru_RU (thanks, VGamerGroup!);\n  - uk_UA (thanks, unroman!);\n  - zh_CN (thanks, NumberSir);\n  - zh_TW (thanks, Lobster0228!);","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-22T02:29:40.176044Z","downloads":391390,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"71daa55fd88b6f181c51ec6892600415df591f64","sha512":"bd025d539511beddd6826896604d2aae17b035fd7ae03c4ae659be3df802f4190b91f935b32a07a69842ad98f79bfbdcc3ef6d0e1e540b35989a806c655b4168"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/R2OftAxM/versions/AxgOboGq/FarmersDelight-1.20.1-1.2.4.jar","filename":"FarmersDelight-1.20.1-1.2.4.jar","primary":true,"size":2915349,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"gg7pp5NT","user":{"id":"btHGOarG","username":"vectorwing","name":"Lucas Barcellos","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5566692?v=4","bio":"Heyo!

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n¬†\n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n¬†\n- Custom map markers:¬†\nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n¬†\n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n¬†\n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows).¬†\nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n¬†\n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily.

Old worlds using More Red are generally not compatible with this update.\n\n## New Features\n* Added the Pulse Gate, a block that generates a 2-tick pulse after receiving an input signal and does not produce a signal again until you turn it off and on again.\n* Wire blocks and wire posts are now compatible with structure pieces; they can be rotated and mirrored, and their connected positions will generally respect this when saved and loaded by structure blocks in different orientations.\n\n## Data Changes\n* The gatecrafting_plinth block has been renamed to soldering_table. The gatecrafting recipe type has been renamed to soldering. Gatecrafting recipe files have been renamed accordingly.\n* The \"morered:red_alloy_ingot_with_jumbo_furnace\" recipe has been renamed to \"morered:red_alloy_ingot_from_jumbo_smelting\"\n* The \"morered:red_alloy_ingot_without_jumbo_furnace\" recipe has been removed\n* Added a \"transform\" blockstate property to wire blocks and wire posts. This has eight values: `identity`, `rot_180_face_xz`, `rot_90_y_neg`, `rot_90_y_pos`, `invert_x`, `invert_z`, `swap_xz`, and `swap_neg_xz`. Blocks placed by players will normally have the 'identity' state, this state is only changed when the block is rotated/mirrored (e.g. by structure blocks).\n* Wire posts' remote connection positions are now stored as relative positions. If the block has an altered transform state, the saved positions will be normalized to the 'identity' transform (and un-normalized when loaded). Wire blocks' per-side power storage is similar transformed.\n\n## Other Changes\n* Jumbo Furnace is now bundled with More Red via forge jar-in-jar\n\n\n1.19.2-3.0.0.2\n * Reenable JEI support. Oops!\n\n1.19.2-3.0.0.1\n * Fix crash when placing unplaceable blocks near blockless wires.

This fixes not being disconnected from servers.\n### 3.4.4\n- Fixed integrated server crashes not being caught.\n- Fixed state sometimes not being cleaned up properly which could cause the game to infinitely crash.\n### 3.4.3\n- Fixed deobfuscation not working in dedicated servers, courtesy of @Fourmisain!\n### 3.4.2\n- Prevented extreme cases where the crash log could become incredibly large. \n- Fixed the crash screen not showing suspected mods in cases where adding them to the crash log was prevented by conflicting mods.\n### 3.4.1\n- Improved internal error message.\n## 3.4.0\n- Provided many configuration options for uploading the crash logs, see NecConfig.java, thanks to The456Gamer!\n- The config format for uploading crash logs has changed, refer to NecConfig.java for the new format. \n## 3.3.1\n- Fixed mod identification not working.\n- Fixed deobfuscation sometimes not working.\n- Promoted to Release!\n## 3.3.0\n- Updated to Minecraft 1.17, Java 16. \n- Currently buggy, this is a minimum viable alpha release.\n## 3.2.0\n- Added a new option `forceCrashScreen` that will prevent cases in which the game closes with no crash log. Instead, the game will crash normally.\n### 3.1.9\n- Fixed additional crash stack traces appearing when debugModIdentification is false. \n### 3.1.8\n- The 1.16.5 Fabric version will no longer deliberately crash in 1.17 snapshots. This means that it may work if nothing broke the mod in a snapshot.\n### 3.1.7\n- Added a new config option: debugModIdentification, that will hopefully help in discovering mods in more cases.\n### 3.1.6\n- (Forge) Fixed being unable to identify crashing mods that have multiple authors.\n### 3.1.5\n- Made it so the Curseforge page can be reached through the Mod Menu entry.\n### 3.1.4\n- Fixed Forge version not working at all.\n### 3.1.3\n- Made NEC more compatible with other mods, specifically with [Structure Gel API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structure-gel-api).\n### 3.1.1\n- Fixed mod not loading.\n## 3.1.0\n- Added extra info for feature/structure crashes to make it much easier to find the problematic mod, courtesy of TelepathicGrunt!.\n# 3.0.0\n- Now supports Forge!\n## 2.2.0\n- Removed 'feature' that would instantly crash the game when pressing F3+C instead of after 6 seconds, since that hotkey is used to copy location information.\n- Added a proper mod icon.\n### 2.1.4\n- Improved Simplified Chinese localization, courtesy of @WuzgXY!\n### 2.1.3\n- Fixed \"upload crashlog\" not working :) .\n### 2.1.1\n- Fixed \"upload crashlog\" not working.\n## 2.1.0\n- Added Estonian localization, courtesy of @Madis0!\n# 2.0.0\n- Fixed the mod not working in Fabric Loader 0.9.0+, however, this and the following versions will only work for the 0.9.0+ Fabric Loader versions.\n### 1.2.4\n- Will no longer blame jumploader for errors all the time\n### 1.2.3\n- Fixed an incompatibility with LambdaControls (mostly just a mistake, not really an incompatibility).\n- Crash logs will now be uploaded as gists instead of to the dimdev haste. This can be reverted by setting `uploadCrashLogTo` to `DIMDEV_HASTE` in the config.\n- Fixed some GUI bugs in the crash scree\n### 1.2.1\n- Compatibility with [Multiconnect](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multiconnect/files).  \n  Note: Informed Load has yet to publish the compatible version.\n## 1.2.0\n- Compatibility with [Informed Load](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/informed-load).\n### 1.1.5\n- Fixed a rare error.\n### 1.1.4\n- Fixed the window not closing when pre-initialization errors occur.\n### 1.1.3\n- Initialization errors will now be printed as soon as an error is caught, instead of only when displaying the crash screen.\n- The init error screen will now display in more disaster cases.\n### 1.1.2\n- Fixed the entry point catcher not being enabled...\n### 1.1.1\n- Forgot a debug flag\n## 1.1.0\n- Added an API for running code when the game crashes to prevent the window getting stuck in weird states.\n### 1.0.11\n- Fixed two \"Not Enough Crashes deobfuscated stack trace\" lines appearing (instead of just one).\n### 1.0.10\n- Fixed an exception while starting game.\n# 1.0.9\nReleased\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-16T06:52:31.793354Z","downloads":150926,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"9128836e8bed4ff60f5569b0541a132eafa009275657c6816792b210d31b8cb9f83afc9469335f0018890484c0b744b4ad0be865ee4f89ad665eac05ca27cafb","sha1":"0cd0d0f49762dcaf3716e72c5e159ed9645ce468"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/yM94ont6/versions/W6W0bVtN/notenoughcrashes-4.4.7%2B1.20.1-forge.jar","filename":"notenoughcrashes-4.4.7+1.20.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":133125,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"Fq2yZa5i","user":{"id":"gRvRzBFY","username":"natanfudge","name":"Fudge","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25990014?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T14:48:59.369715Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"notenoughcrashes-4.4.7+1.20.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\create_power_loader-1.5.0-mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"c22b806fca4fb8339cfd070a788cbe5b4fabe789531bef9fe1034c9ba00b8980cac1d9eddd26b5192ddb77fc9f39d70e6e61fc1117b7303545b6dd2f1969170b","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"wPQ6GgFE","slug":"create-power-loader","project_type":"mod","team":"p9qS5moJ","title":"Create: Power Loader","description":"A Create mod add-on adding immersive chunk loaders.","body":"<h1 align=\"center\">Create: Power Loader</h1>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-power-loader/files\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/936020_all.svg\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/create-power-loader/\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/wPQ6GgFE?style=flat&label=Modrinth\"></a>\n    <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-power-loader\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/curseforge/dt/936020?style=flat&label=CurseForge\"></a>\n</p>\n\nA Create mod add-on adding immersive andesite and brass chunk loaders to Minecraft.\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/cd02548b-be01-4a01-b707-ffcb913f5299.webp)](https://bisecthosting.com/lysine)\n\n> **Want more Create-esque QoL items?

Each light source has its unique color and can contribute to fog lighting depending on the scene, weather, dimension and other things.\n\nMany shaderpacks with 3D volumetric clouds have a problem of them leaking into closed spaces like caves or mountains. Solas fixes that problem by toggling a cloud shadow check in cases when a closed space is detected, thus essentially turning volumetric clouds into volumetric light.\n\nAnother problem a lot of shaderpacks have is shadow light leaking and peter panning which is minimized in Solas.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Key Aspects**\n+ 3D volumetric clouds, volumetric light, volumetric Nether & End fog.\n+ Water, atmospheric and border fog.\n+ Water light absorption and refraction.\n+ Fast multicolored block lighting.\n+ Fancy sky effects: Aurora Borealis, Milky Way, Ender Nebula, Ender Vortex and more.\n+ Cinematic post effects: bloom, chromatic aberration, depth of field, distant blur, TAA, FXAA.\n+ Integrated PBR resourcepack featuring specular mapping, generated normals and emission.\n+ Support for LabPBR and SeusPBR resourcepacks.\n+ Advanced lighting model: ambient occlusion, variable penumbra shadows and specular highlights.\n+ Many customizable options with their proper translations to English, Russian, Chinese, French and Spanish languages.\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Support my work on Boosty!**\n\nhttps://boosty.to/septonious\n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Credits**\n\n+ SixthSurge for VX LPV algorithm\n+ EminGT and gri573 for improved shadow sampling\n+ Capt Tatsu for TAA, FXAA and a few other pieces of BSL's code","published":"2022-12-13T19:07:08.160319Z","updated":"2024-07-01T12:59:38.568536Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":747450,"followers":682,"categories":["colored-lighting","fantasy","pbr"],"additional_categories":["atmosphere","bloom","cartoon","foliage","low","reflections","semi-realistic","shadows"],"game_versions":["1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"],"versions":["y4j12BxK","ogGYWNdQ","bNMgAWCx","YZMWbh4h","xHgx5Bvx","WavyjcdU","IFUoT1yb","ktRmeTUY","AvWzJIv6","3mGi0Tm7","QFQv6Wsp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/78660094ffc8b00c1f805137250401309991bc2b.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"AvWzJIv6","project_id":"EpQFjzrQ","author_id":"dilHPVn4","featured":false,"name":"Solas Shader V2.0 [BETA V0.6b]","version_number":"0.6b","changelog":"Everything has changed\nAdded voxelized LPV (Iris only)\n...","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-27T13:16:24.615915Z","downloads":213619,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"e628f6b7064682f8f3a4a06a2ff981a12b81e722","sha512":"51c9d62618dfaa6bd7c0d913820afac16866b121f718ca1a63497e6ec191f0d83849fd4a7c05fee31179e70f5d7d84523c49b8f83af4212d8376ea0084941800"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/EpQFjzrQ/versions/AvWzJIv6/Solas%20Shader%20V2.0%20%5BBETA%200.6b%5D.zip","filename":"Solas Shader V2.0 [BETA 0.6b].zip","primary":true,"size":1155325,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["iris","optifine"]},"members":[{"team_id":"FeXBCccN","user":{"id":"dilHPVn4","username":"septonious","name":"Septonious","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/83358692?v=4","bio":"I make shaders","created":"2021-07-23T13:39:53.718189Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Solas Shader V2.0 [BETA 0.6b].zip"},"mods\\PigPen-Forge-1.20.1-15.0.2.jar":{"sha512":"43fa348e5c4eaded108073d5416bc4316df175aeb143a4da103b5c945ba2057aca29c3a8530371ca84970a781a4435d215ebfb9bee2e4d073d4f0c8d0c9991e6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"2xZPITh8","slug":"pig-pen-cipher","project_type":"mod","team":"zqtF9yuD","title":"Pig Pen Cipher","description":"Adds the pigpen cipher to Minecraft","body":"<p>This mod adds the <a href=\"/linkout?remoteUrl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pig Pen Cipher</a> to Minecraft as a new font. This can be used for books, fonts, chat messages, tooltips, and virtually any other text in the game.</p>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>The Pig Pen Cipher is a simple substitution cipher used to encode messages which use the English alphabet.</p>\n<p><code></code><img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2xZPITh8/images/254f5498fe8081898af18cbb79358cd170de0d95.png\" width=\"144\" height=\"178\"></p>\n\n<h2>User Guide</h2>\n<h3>Using the Cipher</h3>\n<p>The Pigpen Cipher is sometimes referred to as a tic-tac-toe cipher. This is because the key used to encode/decode characters looks like a tic-tac-toe board.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Pigpen_cipher_key.svg/330px-Pigpen_cipher_key.svg.png\" width=\"165\" height=\"165\"></p>\n<p>To write a character using the Pigpen Cipher you simply replace the character with the lines that surround the character. For example if you want to write the letter A you would draw a backwards L shape and an E would be drawn as a square. If the symbol contains a dot you would use the version on the right, so a square with a dot inside of it is an N. The eight lower characters follow the same rules, T would be an arrow pointing right and W would be an arrow pointing down with a dot in it.</p>\n<p>While the cipher may seem complicated at first it will become a lot easier to understand with some practice.</p>\n\n<h3>Commands</h3>\n<p>If this mod is installed on a Forge server you will be able to use some custom commands to help you use this mod. These commands can also be used in single player if the mod is installed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>/pigpen say - Posts a message in chat using the cipher. All players can use this command. The plaintext version is logged in the server console.</li>\n<li>/pigpen hand - Renames the held item with cipher. Limited to lvl 2 ops.</li>\n<li>/pigpen book (encode|decode) - Rewrites a held book to use cipher. Can also turn encoded books into plaintext books. Limited to lvl 2 ops.</li>\n<li>/pigpen tile (encode|decode) &lt;pos&gt; - Rewrites a tile entity such as a sign to use cipher. Limited to lvl 2 ops.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Code</h3>\n<p>If you're developing a mod or have access to code/scripting tools you can apply the cipher to an ITextComponent by modifying the style of the component.</p>\n<p>// MCP names not yet available<br>// func_240703_c_ = setStyle<br>// func_240719_a_ = setFontId<br>IFormattableTextComponent text = new StringTextComponent(\"Hello World\");<br>text.func_240703_c_(text.getStyle().func_240719_a_(new ResourceLocation(\"pigpen\", \"pigpen\")));</p>\n\n<h3>Vanilla Commands &amp; NBT</h3>\n<p>Any vanilla command which allows you to specify a text component can use cipher by defining the font ID in the text properties. For example it can be used in the give command, or in the title command.</p>\n\n<p>/give @p stone{display:{Name:\"[{\\\"text\\\":\\\"Hello\\\",\\\"italic\\\":false,\\\"color\\\":\\\"gold\\\",\\\"font\\\":\\\"pigpen:pigpen\\\"}]\"}} 1</p>\n<p>/title @a title {\"text\":\"Hello\",\"font\":\"pigpen:pigpen\"}</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br><br><img src=\"https://skulk.blmj.red/pig-pen-cipher\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\"></p>\n","published":"2023-06-07T05:55:44.132992Z","updated":"2024-02-01T21:03:21.553144Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":134028,"followers":27,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["Wija88m5","Rxaotkhk","cDXe3J18","2tHj0zbf","zql1bF3C","xSNA6Sms","7rKiHAc9","2hb5fac1","9fPaq23y","aofu7LWM","Mq13xU9k","TE3OyPhi","YhN4Idx7","Mj4oO6Ls","Upw7t1Gd","VVk5gWa5","fU3i2s28","2qcew3sW","tCG3urAf","hu9YsIc0","94mWNMIz","YVWchYfB","IQJmbuAj","l7cq0Xf5","uayf0LbF","H93TDBVt","XDoH9Go7","2MlTN0AW","xiVTGONd","H8WcHl8X","EUPmY8Ud","3HDRYMF1","WBxJMv8f","PIvBdoW5","iiaasf4O","bHBaRYTm","WgjhZu0K","r2dLWdiV","d8ZQfLyL","KphE9fNY","lhfkHQku","SVFDYJHK","mfKA99wK","5wBEdaA1","ABM6pKOq","UhdyikON","FvoW2lTC","u0J1SIL2","lPTQNz8K","afV4hAH0","N3Sx2HbJ","M5TgRvJA","kY9vkyYK","mkIvCkmo","CXUFKlTE","o7oP8MTs","GgGyRMzG","MCLMCiRs","WLJMc9WT","klyNDHCI","jF4sHQFN","1zg6DChu","I7V53ZnI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2xZPITh8/2f7df9723b7974686cdf4051fa043a515d507c6c.png"},"version":{"id":"SVFDYJHK","project_id":"2xZPITh8","author_id":"TiqUUK2E","featured":false,"name":"PigPen-Forge-1.20.1-15.0.2","version_number":"15.0.2","changelog":"No changelog was specified.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-21T01:54:34.703889Z","downloads":13318,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"2885041c28bc1cba74ad73d9846b53b26539232a","sha512":"43fa348e5c4eaded108073d5416bc4316df175aeb143a4da103b5c945ba2057aca29c3a8530371ca84970a781a4435d215ebfb9bee2e4d073d4f0c8d0c9991e6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/2xZPITh8/versions/SVFDYJHK/PigPen-Forge-1.20.1-15.0.2.jar","filename":"PigPen-Forge-1.20.1-15.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":5350,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"zqtF9yuD","user":{"id":"TiqUUK2E","username":"Darkhax","name":"Tyler Hancock","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2250798?v=4","bio":"Software developer with niche hobbies.

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nYou can also configure these settings for when you're idling (with a custom timeout) or while your laptop / handheld is on battery.  \nOptionally you may also display the current battery status on the in-game HUD and receive toast notifications about battery activity.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops\nrendering the world while it's being obscured by resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nEnabling the battery integration requires downloading an additional library at runtime.  \nThe mod contains the hashes for these files ahead of time and will verify them before usage.\n\nYou may disable this behavior in the mod's settings, or [install the library yourself](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/blob/main/docs/manual-natives-install.md) if you wish.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-06-30T17:40:08.218955Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4918345,"followers":3910,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b","1.21-pre1","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR","jeq5Pk2P","TsACcqoR","zABNE034","RS3zegai","RCY49qLv","GzuwoJDO","U0tp6QIQ","mUoNvE18","ANanuCGR","XNQmNGUo","H3jM6EoR","aM6FmhY7","TLSV8m3h","LF4zDKeR","MbErXFSW","F7x3PReU","z9Xj6TuQ","NU3HRHXj","PyDPmXHD","wzp3skkc","aPRTCnlc","5fk6vDb1","U1cZ1TL7","8Hd00M1M","OjAim4Jo","ESoagl4C","pHWNKS7t","BNf9EmNl","JRl3y7rm","tEiWfX1N","uHnzIEQj","dliDieeY","wBsh7vqV","YF37wYKK","FonmH7YD","nTdQW3oL","KEs1F4M2","pMITUDDN","RYTZvQBc","TSSDSiZP","kbiP4CMi","qRc80r3o","jdsdQwkB","6FJB6Cff","DdDJ86cX","Xd3OWazo","eRegd530","jVjy8fjK","aLCEN12X","lSXJY9xl","FFFxotk0","JiiW7oPc","LlYJQJc0","imrXtkp1","GCbqf3Es","FxizL9t5","1nYqpxqz","ks5hKqn1","t4XJUfdJ","TfKF27MT","9gdFVbPJ","LP8Tu8Ll","G9r3hXu4","b1zBQl0B","5e8bQR5b","lb0ERSTU","zVtEuiz1","mXDQxXwm","dXkCBME4","oFct4NKJ","WJuoKsuM","AhFXokhh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"lb0ERSTU","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.6.0","version_number":"3.6.0","changelog":"-

Forge).</p>\n<p>This library mod will be the starting point for common code I need for all my mods (Utility methods, abstractions, interfaces and so on).</p>\n<p>Also, this mod adds a guidebook (built with Patchouli) for all my mods so players can have some help to get started.</p>\n<p>I don't recommend anybody to build on top of this as I won't provide documentation and will change things radically to suit my mods' needs.</p>\n<h2>Socials</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a title=\"Sebastrn's Curseforge\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/itssebastrn/projects\"

In that sense, it is an automatic _Cutting Board_.  \nIn order to use it, the correct tool has to be placed into the machine, using `Right-Click`.\nBy default, only knives and axes are allowed, but this behaviour can be overwritten by modifying the `sliceanddice:allowed_tools` item tag.\nAn example datapack which adds shears to this tag can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/raw/1.20.x/example_datapack.zip)\n\n### Automatic Cooking\n\nAll recipes from Farmer's delight requiring the Cooking Pot are added as heated mixing recipes.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/cooking.png)\n\n### Sprinkler\n\nThe Sprinkler is a block which, when provided with a fluid using a pipe, will distribute it in a small area below.  \nDifferent fluids can have different effects.\n\n- Lava applies a small amount of fire damage to entities below\n- Water makes the area below wet, making the world think it's raining there.\n- Potions apply their affect for a short duration to entities below\n- Liquid Fertilizer, a new fluid, applies a bonemeal affect to blocks.\n\nThe latter is meant to enable growing of _Banana Fonds_ from [Neapolitan][NEAPOLITAN] without being dependent on the weather, but it could possibly have other effects on other mods too.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/sprinkler.png)\n\n### Overweight Farming\n\nIf present, some compatibility features for [Overweight Farming][OVERWEIGHT_FARMING] is added.  \nThis includes waxing recipes using the deployer,\nas well as showing the axe-stripping of overweight crops in JEI.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/strip.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/wax.png)\n","published":"2022-08-14T17:09:40.957018Z","updated":"2024-06-12T14:44:56.282004Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":699379,"followers":381,"categories":["food","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["UJTc0pk2","1wP6CNfI","Nk2dO6Go","KriL1JFW","r4yDHtFN","tA385l8n","JH33REuT","tZZRCOac","lXNFlrvW","OIhe0uO4","ZmhTpjLR","pRwBOCJc","gCGCFJis","hPDyRNw3","lrslRK8c","fGG0Gjcv","mG1fIOia","akAH2F1g","89gCgL8n","FF8UA0pu","LfIs9gRN","PmCarZvQ","BZLiJ13y","O8bSqUaV","sGqyWl93","U9GIWHMX","uv6f7FCw","t8iOd0XR","7HTroPJk","kvrLbSxC","1aTrUinS","qWFV16cD","3wyhfJQQ","vd7c2RPJ","mTr2nUPj","t3lFXxzY","aRK21L9m","qaNqtys9","nkNOsYBR","rYnuEPwn","tAgVGTaW","s9l4uqVE","IlpHtI0z","ZEitGVtL","73nfCddX","etRuKHcg","yZ9zZESN","giM4WleV","ZgvbijiO","tz8HfyEB","BWLxCZmk","W15dmG2v","fIWeey09","GsUN2gpi","ZfE7RsnM"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/9af7f38727e4c1dc30c67fefd80b15000a2b8c07.png"},"version":{"id":"giM4WleV","project_id":"GmjmRQ0A","author_id":"qxswSLtS","featured":false,"name":"Forge 3.2.0","version_number":"3.2.0","changelog":"- Update to create `0.5.1.d`","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T07:59:42.465008Z","downloads":195194,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f964b626e90acb7145113c342eb915c5df834778","sha512":"250319673ff37fcedf6f0ace7c894dcb94fbf7614ef1ea26d78e326f6810cf45ffafa6bb15f0ebeff28b2435f1b272a671f37aa101c17da08e51138bf0c3ba22"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/versions/giM4WleV/sliceanddice-forge-3.2.0.jar","filename":"sliceanddice-forge-3.2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":224151,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"LNytGWDc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ordsPcFz","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"R2OftAxM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"l7tsXKAD","user":{"id":"qxswSLtS","username":"possible_triangle","name":"Possible Triangle","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12880806?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-06-13T20:35:57.654377Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sliceanddice-forge-3.2.0.jar"},"mods\\kubejs-create-forge-2001.2.5-build.2.jar":{"sha512":"629756b7d6504fe4d989ce60a5ca785ab2ad17dc018d4766a437d7b2b384db9c5930c257c484874168c8f832f4503d174e13513dce16c4b983e0e141f1b95250","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"T38eAZQC","slug":"kubejs-create","project_type":"mod","team":"p2d14DeK","title":"KubeJS Create","description":"KubeJS Create integration","body":"[Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create) integration for [KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs). This mod allows you to add and properly edit recipes of Create mod in KubeJS scripts. All supported recipe types and examples are below. See [Recipes page](https://mods.latvian.dev/books/kubejs/page/recipeeventjs) for more info.\n\nSupported recipe types:\n\n- `createCrushing`\n- `createCutting`\n- `createMilling`\n- `createBasin`\n- `createMixing` (supports **.heated()** and **.superheated()**)\n- `createCompacting` (supports **.heated()** and **.superheated()**)\n- `createPressing`\n- `createSandpaperPolishing`\n- `createSplashing` (Bulk Washing)\n- `createDeploying`\n- `createFilling`\n- `createEmptying`\n\n> Note: Bulk Smoking = vanilla smoking and Bulk Blasting = vanilla blasting recipe types.\n\n`event.recipes.createCrushing(output[], input[])`\nOutput doesn't have to be an array. It can be either items or fluids\nInput doesn't have to be an array. It can be either ingredients or `Fluid.of('minecraft:water', 1000)` or `{fluidTag: 'some:fluid_tag', amount: 1000}`\n\n### `createMechanicalCrafting`\n\n`event.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting(output, pattern[], {patternKey: input})`\n\nThis recipe type is the same as regular crafting table shaped recipe\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly(output[], input, sequence[]) \n// output[] are your output items\n// input is your input item\n// sequence[] is an array of sequences. These sequences are \"regular\" recipes that are supported.\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createCrushing([\n  '2x minecraft:cobblestone',\n  'minecraft:redstone',\n  Item.of('minecraft:redstone').withChance(0.5)\n], 'minecraft:redstone_ore')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMixing('create:chromatic_compound', [\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  '#forge:dusts/glowstone',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:powdered_obsidian',\n  'create:polished_rose_quartz'\n]).superheated()\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createFilling('create:blaze_cake', [\n  'create:blaze_cake_base',\n  Fluid.of('minecraft:lava', 250)\n])\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createEmptying([\n  'minecraft:glass_bottle',\n  Fluid.of('create:honey', 250)\n], 'minecraft:honey_bottle')\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createMechanicalCrafting('minecraft:piston', [\n  'CCCCC',\n  'CPIPC',\n  'CPRPC'\n], {\n  C: '#forge:cobblestone',\n  P: '#minecraft:planks',\n  R: '#forge:dusts/redstone',\n  I: '#forge:ingots/iron'\n})\n```\n\n```javascript\nevent.recipes.createSequencedAssembly([ // start the recipe\n Item.of('6x create:large_cogwheel').withChance(32.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n Item.of('create:brass_ingot').withChance(2.0), // have this item be an output with a certain chance\n 'minecraft:andesite', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'create:cogwheel', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:stick', // have this item be a guaranteed output\n 'minecraft:iron_nugget' // have this item be a guaranteed output\n], 'create:brass_ingot', [ // 'create:brass_ingot' is the input.\n// the transitional item set by \"transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel')\" is the item that will be used during the recipe as the item that the input is using to transition to the output.\n event.recipes.createDeploying('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', ['create:incomplete_large_cogwheel', '#minecraft:planks']), // like a normal recipe function, is used as a sequence step in this array.

Input and output have the transitional item\n]).transitionalItem('create:incomplete_large_cogwheel').loops(6) // set the transitional item and the loops (amount of repetitions)\n```\n\nIf you want to use your own transitional item in sequenced_assembly recipes, you must register it in startup event:\n\n```javascript\nonEvent('item.registry', event => {\n  // Texture for this item goes in kubejs/assets/kubejs/textures/item/my_part.png\n  event.create('my_part', 'create:sequenced_assembly').displayName('My Part')\n})\n```\n\nThen you would use ...`transitionalItem('kubejs:my_part')`...\n\n> Note! Mysterious Conversion recipes are client side only, so the only way to add them currently is using reflection with this code in client scripts (outside any event):\n\n```javascript\nlet MysteriousItemConversionCategory = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.category.MysteriousItemConversionCategory')\nlet ConversionRecipe = java('com.simibubi.create.compat.jei.ConversionRecipe')\n\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:apple', 'minecraft:carrot'))\nMysteriousItemConversionCategory.RECIPES.add(ConversionRecipe.create('minecraft:golden_apple', 'minecraft:golden_carrot'))\n```\n\n[![](https://kubejs.com/discord.png)](https://discord.gg/lat)","published":"2023-08-21T20:20:41.279415Z","updated":"2023-11-20T15:07:35.257690Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":131237,"followers":33,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":["library"],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["MO75e2sC","YN0T5Pmf","dvLO7wuv","T4V6Dm0l","cNEVOQ4q","bnvthbJW","uMNhEyBG","79c3Pl6W","VwLRcUBQ","Khlo8swW","b3ZbuHEY","eRR2DuIi","CDoBzOhr","qmHwp7h4","gUgBKKro","r6cVLbDS","I3cYQ3mX","pLyqKVXT","ftDL2MOo","XABryG8V","VszJSnhB","1INYEb9w","oRValdcl","mHfUZDSO","m9lk8iMr","65oHVwN8","VLiijTOY","rJ26X7G5","2Hq8tbrn","dxY7VzQv","zWLaf3WR","Yp60zntL","B4zWSIIO","8qUQlsto","zmzcrZEp","y7FC6Rsp","YE9yQwxx","353BVKVV","hYdnSDQB","13yE1QX6","Jqn5DRIj","A0KQFxde","Xe2y2pRp","FhVbUfLB","ClnUsQ85","HJ0xIlkM","PB33MOc1","hei9cDRa"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/T38eAZQC/511b709655f4853df9ff9f3731fc1df6d2c4a20a.png"},"version":{"id":"hei9cDRa","project_id":"T38eAZQC","author_id":"7tgPcl7v","featured":false,"name":"KubeJS

No code was taken, only the idea.","published":"2021-04-11T09:38:08.008060Z","updated":"2024-05-23T12:43:09.660636Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":182765,"followers":412,"categories":["game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["kyjJQ6is","NQmkmN36","2maMKx5T","6jbcl9c6","EGIMsnwc","fjgH8VUW","TuxALvSu","HnEdtPAA","OuxiHpnF","BPNCpouX","d4aBYiqJ","MZ3KFvJD","xRFlf1Co","Yzz234vY","KIjmjizn","LjDUjZCq","yEyvB3UM","6RvulguJ","wQCx7LxJ","bMwjs3jk","Snmnhtv7","O5rb19U4","HVJFHnm0","hTA88KZf","k7fgGv6V","UdBtR2xM","I0zqOeJG","gZ1xkqNs","AlYgBMY1","FIBdjomr","B0IoQ4DN","hpR2Y8l4","gaDYXPBy","tkf6AdLD"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jCBrrLTs/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"hpR2Y8l4","project_id":"jCBrrLTs","author_id":"INxNlPeV","featured":false,"name":"1.3.13-forge","version_number":"1.3.13","changelog":"remove Waystones compatibility for newer Forge and NeoForge versions since it now uses an XP cost by default","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-23T12:42:18.799078Z","downloads":4391,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"5444689fbc979071d125c1f6a42ecde5738a65b892c715430b5f6658864a86aa1ab57f44901497fdf3009c602fb7b57337d4eb4ea01c517d30a38b99c77b285a","sha1":"bdbade96b8b8bdd5efeaffb92ca7346434edb146"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/jCBrrLTs/versions/hpR2Y8l4/TaxFreeLevels-1.3.13-forge-1.20.2.jar","filename":"TaxFreeLevels-1.3.13-forge-1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":19380,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"izaW93I5","user":{"id":"INxNlPeV","username":"Fourmisain","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8464472?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-24T22:05:23.378029Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TaxFreeLevels-1.3.13-forge-1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\create_oppenheimered-1.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"118720bbbf2cf85ded2de19639ce14c7e107d277208f064f0c627770797ce6517ddd92053c31d574c59f1a2822538fbea86becefa343378d493877b7cc7c4543","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"7qOxePw2","slug":"create-oppenheimered","project_type":"mod","team":"ceRZLllf","title":"Create: Oppenheimered","description":"Adds some crafting compatibility between Alex's Caves and Create","body":"Create: Oppenheimered is a mod which allows certain items from Alex's Caves to be crafted automatically using machines from Create.

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com//partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-06-14T21:20:00.112947Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":8730388,"followers":5624,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F","DHBIGCNn","F3RXDl1W","TOyoOLwn","7ZgGD02s","KRGWwoZW","1LVdHUaX","3VAtIiWX","cj8nR3eG","VgDjay7P","p2L3IXut","6U5rh26a","Gggee1My","LXLEbjiC","Bu3hSiJb"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"DHBIGCNn","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.6-1.20.1 - Forge","version_number":"1.6.6","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Update to 1.21\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.5...1.6.6","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-14T21:18:53.168177Z","downloads":96563,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0d4c1262af012d8bc18acbf7640fe05f20bbd007410160b404c94b409997e8df1230bd851bcc21697938b24f2237a62c025db68fe61aadde316b490d76b73b75","sha1":"cc2e44cd3260f98ef35297854e5154a36add36cc"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/DHBIGCNn/entityculling-forge-1.6.6-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-forge-1.6.6-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":71139,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/poie5Iwy/107197d35f2df9a1b4f3f2c09ccbe65a1df9bd82.png","bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

Its main focus lies in reducing the lag caused by redstone dust, by optimizing the power calculations and reducing the number of shape and block updates emitted. As a side effect of these changes the block update order of redstone dust networks is predictable and intuitive rather than locational and chaotic.\n\n### Performance\n\nMSPT contributions of redstone dust are up to 20 times lower with Alternate Current, all the while maintaining a high level of Vanilla parity. Its low number of code modifications make it minimally invasive, so it's an easy drop-in replacement for Vanilla redstone dust.\n\nCheck out the [GitHub page](https://github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/alternate-current/blob/main/README.md) for a detailed explanation of Alternate Current's improvements.\n\n## Why is redstone dust so laggy?\n\nThere are two main reasons why redstone dust is laggy: unnecessary updates and unnecessary calculations, both of which are caused by the fact that redstone dust updates recursively. A redstone wire can update its power level over half a dozen times before settling on the final value, doing expensive calculations and emitting copious amounts of shape and block updates each time. On top of that, many shape and block updates are completely redundant. \n\n## How does Alternate Current fix that?\n\nAlternate Current fixes these issues by doing power calculations of the entire network before updating the power levels. Each wire will check power from non-wire components just once and power from other wires just twice. Power sources within the network are identified, and the power is spread from there. This makes the calculations more efficient and the update order more intuitive. Shape and block updates are only emitted when the final power level is reached, and each wire emits no redundant updates.","published":"2021-04-05T18:22:08.996630Z","updated":"2024-06-22T16:08:17.417548Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":690735,"followers":759,"categories":["optimization","technology","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["a1.0.11","a1.0.14","a1.0.15","a1.0.16","a1.0.17_02","a1.0.17_04","a1.1.0","a1.1.2","a1.1.2_01","a1.2.0","a1.2.0_01","a1.2.0_02","a1.2.1","a1.2.1_01","a1.2.2a","a1.2.2b","a1.2.3","a1.2.3_01","a1.2.3_02","a1.2.3_04","a1.2.4_01","a1.2.5","a1.2.6","b1.0","b1.0_01","b1.0.2","b1.1_01","b1.1_02","b1.2","b1.2_01","b1.2_02","b1.3b","b1.3_01","b1.4","b1.4_01","b1.5","b1.5_01","b1.6","b1.6.1","b1.6.2","b1.6.3","b1.6.4","b1.6.5","b1.6.6","b1.7","b1.7.2","b1.7.3","b1.8","b1.8.1","1.0","1.1","1.2.1","1.2.2","1.2.3","1.2.4","1.2.5","1.3","1.3.1","1.3.2","1.4","1.4.1","1.4.2","1.4.3","1.4.4","1.4.5","1.4.6","1.4.7","1.5","1.5.1","1.5.2","1.6","1.6.1","1.6.2","1.6.3","1.6.4","1.7","1.7.1","1.7.2","1.7.3","1.7.4","1.7.5","1.7.6","1.7.7","1.7.8","1.7.9","1.7.10","1.8","1.8.1","1.8.2","1.8.3","1.8.4","1.8.5","1.8.6","1.8.7","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.9","1.9.1","1.9.2","1.9.3","1.9.4","1.10","1.10.1","1.10.2","1.11","1.11.1","1.11.2","1.12","1.12.1","1.12.2","1.13","1.13.1","1.13.2","1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["O3ymAMEH","oX2SAJg0","Wcg8QtlB","Ca2crPBC","rdScmQX2","z78WRI0B","CSFStoYN","JZErTOBa","9uewQm0i","1ebDeupo","5OYFZNQb","gKNMWQFe","qZQ7ath8","eKThDBxV","fIgfufLA","MbEV8ysu","oaPAZHeF","30P7c8Sc","cnm8f9GG","N3bxgXDH","DDiRJszQ","GiAWvJK9","LynxUXOP","9F6atBKt","GwY5IFEy","9SXtCwu0","t5DWN1gm","G27JrgiI","HhzkvE6O","N8AvvTfs","DS5ILIxG","txTm74H4","ZF4E7jII","XyChhmMe","sYu2D6ez","MLH4H0y2","2DSIjEoj","emgpmBBm","lQpWSj6j","yQIu276H","XQit89EZ","5vr2yCCO","S4dJ2iyh","1I4OWQil","VWU16jcy","FV0dyi7m","gUosQHld","4QElEqe4","NzZe7tXs","gxfBnR7p","T52JhWsT","cGXi6arS","vettdZX4","u8zKAKt8","ER3cM1dr","F0ROppUm","r0y55em7","xapZdXkF","8NEwN8KM","xPdjvwwA","BvQnpyPj","VkwuA8t1","4nKkKsjy","L6nyX2yD","v9lKbHW6","bVYFJbvx","W78bVcwe","MzCxRhC6","JyMccsNd","jYQUIR7B","FkanfPQt","zrRsTCOk","oUiJaPJ4","otRJ7qRt","ScVaodC7","jeBtGGPj","GHvIXuaf","qmLJQdlV","APKbnFb7","yeEKF5Cu","Y5Q8sEjA","dxOkiCsx","8sC1JfwZ","bM8opJlV","BjloWltb","F7ERk3df","4SkLYef2","kC6SY4Zp","3Y7l1hJc","lxVatUAV","CFNRLnDw","TGC7Ch3w","fA9M0yW3"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/r0v8vy1s/fbb5a094676807df4b5ca1686033d5eb5fc389fd.png"},"version":{"id":"kC6SY4Zp","project_id":"r0v8vy1s","author_id":"f6Ry7Czx","featured":false,"name":"[1.20 Forge] Alternate Current 1.7.0","version_number":"forge-mc1.20-1.7.0","changelog":"updated to Minecraft 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-25T14:51:43.305034Z","downloads":117781,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"02def44a2c416459ee5daecbe1caa6d78571e205","sha512":"d9ae21a3a389c63466bf22b36d4a78c859f30c901397622f1f1438737901a2c67e4d911c83831e0d4f1edabf0b86b58f4192d9980ecef8278393fd4af64a9585"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/r0v8vy1s/versions/kC6SY4Zp/alternate_current-mc1.20-1.7.0.jar","filename":"alternate_current-mc1.20-1.7.0.jar","primary":true,"size":36703,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ICk2lOk1","user":{"id":"f6Ry7Czx","username":"Space Walker","name":"Space Walker","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48224626?v=4","bio":"Redstoner, modder","created":"2021-02-27T19:02:49.428839Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"alternate_current-mc1.20-1.7.0.jar"},"mods\\rhino-forge-2001.2.2-build.18.jar":{"sha512":"1fd5f5667e0f078797112df7ae5f300d2fed2c992fdfd0818569e9286d9bdf6c311cf722cbef542a9ecd78577dde5f88e3cfaa48824d0d75bfede9fd4e1be18e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"sk9knFPE","slug":"rhino","project_type":"mod","team":"zzKhfQN9","title":"Rhino","description":"A fork of Mozilla's Rhino library, modified for use in mods","body":"A fork of Mozilla's Rhino library, modified for use in mods.

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-06-16T09:45:34.688950Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":7572729,"followers":5672,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv","7slRrLO6","BkJB5PPB","wmIZ4wP4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"DG5Fn9Sz","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Forge)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:40:26.306516Z","downloads":621871,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"417fb6ce8f52abf40bd9d0390371790f9576f8ba","sha512":"a1960a7c03dc32d4ccaccaf28afdd9b078758bbd62d15a91d4039a83fa9397a098e89b69591f6bd5190254d9ee97e502504154b9aec764adb8c65f000b75ba2c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/DG5Fn9Sz/ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":123034,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-forge.jar"},"mods\\ars_nouveau-1.20.1-4.9.0-all.jar":{"sha512":"a801456af1f6889eeaa71b101a04c099227910ca7fc8a8de0c84268ae766d34a9591aa47ce39e0879a5a9bd6df8ee6e8180cade342fb37556755703863544e22","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"TKB6INcv","slug":"ars-nouveau","project_type":"mod","team":"BDT3yflD","title":"Ars Nouveau","description":"Craft spells and construct magical automations","body":"Ars Nouveau is a magic mod inspired by Ars Magicka that allows players to craft their own spells, create magical artifacts, perform rituals, and much more.

Like the redeclaration of exported variables, `import` conflict due to priorities, etc.\n- Auto-linting by interop with VSCode will be implemented in 1.21.\n\n### VSCode Extension\n\n- Does not require the installation of ProbeJS extension for any features now.\n- Extension will be rewritten to support a different set of features.\n\n### Forge Events\n\n- Literal support for Forge events is removed in favor of `require` event classes directly.\n\n![7](https://github.com/Prunoideae/ProbeJS/assets/24620047/f8d7cf86-ddbe-4ba5-a3c0-93f2934f797b)\n![6](https://github.com/Prunoideae/ProbeJS/assets/24620047/abd6457e-f6d0-4f44-b234-c4c610b1836e)\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-18T09:30:41.254877Z","downloads":442,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b10620235e860ef293be856c05d9f7c50a17813b898f18b4534cbf25c4da4e97494be98e460a98a449f05ba1c10e29d00aca62ac27f72138057cda1e72a22eee","sha1":"77e3583413568ea27745aeffb2bfc3b0128238ee"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JJNYRb4B/versions/oiljyqSe/probejs-7.0.0-forge.jar","filename":"probejs-7.0.0-forge.jar","primary":true,"size":4342166,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"umyGl7zF","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EOgWrhpy","user":{"id":"EwDnjqIO","username":"Prunoideae","name":"Li Junyu","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/EwDnjqIO/fa394454387ec892d4e146873a766a9efde53276.png","bio":"PhD Student in Marine Environmental Science, HKUST.","created":"2022-06-18T12:56:39.653826Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"probejs-7.0.0-forge.jar"},"mods\\UniversalEnchants-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Forge.jar":{"sha512":"96d876bc3ff34f754ee755b6b6cf224a90a117e2d6512730314b3c2287a47329270e9c806583748b81da14d6e1113be39acf4dc3d57cb528095fc7a7388a6a13","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"DT56YDir","slug":"universal-enchants","project_type":"mod","team":"VjdZ9qU8","title":"Universal Enchants","description":"Better enchantments!

No longer will you have to give tridents a pass just because they can't accept looting.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Also some enchantments have received much needed buffs, and any compatibility restriction between enchantments can be removed (or even added), such as between infinity and mending.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mryq4Zw.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üìö Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Item Compatibility</strong> for many vanilla enchantments is much expanded upon, meaning you can now apply a lot more enchantments to a lot more items. This offers a number of new compatibilities.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Sword:</strong> Impaling</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Axe:</strong> Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, Sweeping Edge, Impaling</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Trident:</strong> Sharpness, Smite, Bane of Arthropods, Knockback, Fire Aspect, Looting, Sweeping Edge, Quick Charge, Piercing</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Bow:</strong> Piercing, Multishot, Quick Charge, Looting</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Crossbow:</strong> Flame, Punch, Power, Infinity, Looting</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Horse Armor:</strong> Protection, Blast Protection, Fire Protection, Projectile Protection, Feather Falling, Respiration, Thorns, Depth Strider, Frost Walker, Curse of Binding, Soul Speed, Curse of Vanishing</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Shield:</strong> Thorns, Knockback</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Changes to <strong>Enchantment Compatibility</strong> make a few enchantments no longer mutually exclusive, specifically mending and infinity, piercing and multishot. Furthermore specialized damage and protection enchantments (e.g. smite and blast protection) are now compatible with the respective base enchantment (sharpness and protection).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Item Compatibility and Enchantment Compatibility are fully configurable for every enchantment (even modded, although not officially supported) using an extensive system of <code>json</code> config files. Compatible items and incompatible enchantments can be individually controlled for all enchantments. To read more on how this system works check out the GitHub source repository.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Additionally with some <strong>Enchantment Improvements</strong> infinity no longer requires even a single arrow to be present, and projectiles grant no more temporary damage immunity, making multishot a lot more useful. Any level of feather falling prevents trampling farmland, and last but not least looting boosts xp drops in addition to item drops.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Universal Enchants also includes an option (which is disabled by default) to <strong>Overhaul The Mending Enchantment</strong>: Gear is no longer repaired using xp. Instead, items with mending can be repaired in any crafting grid by combining the durability with another item of the same kind, or by adding repair material. This works similarly to repairing in an anvil, all enchantments are preserved and no xp is taken. This does not work for combining the enchantments of two items though, only the enchantments from the item with mending are kept.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong><code>/enchant</code> Command</strong> receives a much needed overhaul. Enchantments can be applied with any level, and existing enchantments can be overriden or even removed (by setting the level to 0).

This means the full range of valid numerals (1-255) is supported, opposed to vanilla which doesn't support numerals past 10. If roman numerals just aren't for you, all numerals can also be switched to normal numbers.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mryq4Zw.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üì∑ Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/510/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/511/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>All enchants can be directly applied using enchanting tables or anvils</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible sword enchantments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/523/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/525/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible axe enchantments</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible trident enchantments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/528/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/440/526/2022-03-13_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible bow enchantments</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>All newly compatible crossbow enchantments</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mryq4Zw.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>üí° FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Aren't all those new enchantment combinations kinda overpowered?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> I guess that depends. Some new combinations are extremely useful and should definitely be in vanilla (e.g. infinity crossbows and looting tridents), but yeah, some others might be a bit much. But that has not have to be, since you can disable all enchantments individually in the config. The config includes everything by default for demonstrating all the enchants that are guaranteed to be compatible, fell free to remove any you think are too much.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I can no longer enchant some items added by other mods when Universal Enchants is installed! How can I fix this? (only an issue on Forge)</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Enchanting a few modded items (e.g. Farmer's Delight's skillet) is broken by the internal changes Universal Enchants makes to enchantments. To fix this you'll have to do two things: After installing the mod with the problematic item, delete the universalenchants config folder (found in .minecraft/config) to let it regenerate. It will automatically have additional entries for those problematic items now. Then in the server config enable the <code>allow_mod_item_support</code> option.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of

This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features.

\"xland.mcmod:enchlevel-langpatch:2.2.6\"\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, online javadoc can be found [here](https://teddyxlandlee.github.io/enchlevel-langpatch/javadoc).\n\n### Built-in alternative number formats\n\nSince version `2.x`, the way to **change to roman format** has changed from installing the config mod **to modify several translation values**.\n\nA quick solution is to install [this

The config mod is not mandatory to switch to roman format.\n\nHere are the translation values:\n\n- `langpatch.conf.enchantment.default.type`, which controls enchantment format (under `default` patch).\n- `langpatch.conf.potion.default.type`, which controls potion potency format (under `default` patch).\n\nAcceptable values are (Examples of `123`):\n\n- `numeral` / `number` / `numeric` / `arabic` / `default`: Numeral format (`123`)\n- `roman`: Roman format (`CXXIII`)\n- `simplified` / `chinese` / `zh_normal`: Simplified Chinese (`‰∏ÄÁôæ‰∫åÂçÅ‰∏â`)\n- `traditional` / `zh_upper`: Traditional Chinese, uppercase (`Â£π‰Ω∞Ë≤≥ÊãæÂèÑ`)\n\nPlease note that `default` and `roman` **in the legacy config mod** are now **identical**, the latter one becoming deprecated.\n\nHere's an example for `assets/<any_namespace>/lang/en_us.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"langpatch.conf.enchantment.default.type\": \"roman\",\n  \"langpatch.conf.potion.default.type\": \"roman\"\n} \n```\nThis changes both enchantment and potion potency format into roman format.","published":"2022-12-06T06:00:54.997958Z","updated":"2024-07-02T12:50:23.672610Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":165766,"followers":62,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","20w27a","20w28a","20w29a","20w30a","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","21w05a","21w05b","21w06a","21w07a","21w08a","21w08b","21w10a","21w11a","21w13a","21w14a","21w15a","21w16a","21w17a","21w18a","21w19a","21w20a","1.17-pre1","1.17-pre2","1.17-pre3","1.17-pre4","1.17-pre5","1.17-rc1","1.17-rc2","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1-pre2","1.17.1-pre3","1.17.1-rc1","1.17.1-rc2","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","21w39a","21w40a","21w41a","21w42a","21w43a","21w44a","1.18-pre1","1.18-pre2","1.18-pre3","1.18-pre4","1.18-pre5","1.18-pre6","1.18-pre7","1.18-pre8","1.18-rc1","1.18-rc2","1.18-rc3","1.18-rc4","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","22w11a","22w12a","22w13a","22w13oneblockatatime","22w14a","22w15a","22w16a","22w16b","22w17a","22w18a","22w19a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19-pre5","1.19-rc1","1.19-rc2","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-pre1","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1-pre3","1.19.1-pre4","1.19.1-pre5","1.19.1-pre6","1.19.1-rc2","1.19.1-rc3","1.19.1","1.19.2-rc1","1.19.2-rc2","1.19.2","22w42a","22w43a","22w44a","22w45a","22w46a","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3-pre3","1.19.3-rc1","1.19.3-rc2","1.19.3-rc3","1.19.3","23w03a","23w04a","23w05a","23w06a","23w07a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4-pre2","1.19.4-pre3","1.19.4-pre4","1.19.4-rc1","1.19.4-rc2","1.19.4-rc3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","23w18a","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","23w40a","23w41a","23w42a","23w43a","23w43b","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","24w03a","24w03b","24w04a","24w05a","24w05b","24w06a","24w07a","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b","1.21-pre1","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["wuzR6OBD","m2KxhQ7j","gm4ah6Qr","gl5hXvml","c7fYZCXg","odSesLJN","fjoTwctK","uk7z09t8","FcaALlVQ","ipsgaMqJ","QfoWyMKg"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Lf4kDKU9/9dcde4318df7cf010f06c47049549dc9b17ec287.png"},"version":{"id":"QfoWyMKg","project_id":"Lf4kDKU9","author_id":"aoJ3eDh2","featured":false,"name":"[1.16+/ALL] LangPatch 2.2.6","version_number":"2.2.6","changelog":"Mixin accessor rename;

So all your scripts will go into your `your_minecraft_instance/kubejs/server_scripts` directory. Just create a `.js` file and let's get started.\n\nHere's simple example which adds a gunpowder for creepers:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addEntityLootModifier(\"minecraft:creeper\")\n        .randomChance(0.3) // 30% chance\n        .thenAdd(\"minecraft:gunpowder\");\n});\n```\n\nInstead of using a loot table for reference, you can also apply the modification to all entities:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addLootTypeModifier(LootType.ENTITY) // you also can use multiple types\n        .logName(\"It's raining loot\") // you can set a custom name for logging\n        .weatherCheck({\n            raining: true,\n        })\n        .thenModify(Ingredient.getAll(), (itemStack) => {\n            // you have to return an item!\n            return itemStack.withCount(itemStack.getCount() * 2);\n        });\n});\n```\n\nNext, let's check if the player holds a specific item:\n```js\nonEvent(\"lootjs\", (event) => {\n    event\n        .addBlockLootModifier(\"#forge:ores\") // keep in mind this is a block tag not an item tag\n        .matchEquip(EquipmentSlot.MAINHAND, Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n        .thenAdd(\"minecraft:gravel\");\n\n    // for MainHand and OffHand you can also use:\n    // matchMainHand(Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n    // matchOffHand(Item.of(\"minecraft:netherite_pickaxe\").ignoreNBT())\n});\n```\n\n## **‚öôÔ∏è More Information**\nFor more information about the usage and the functionality of the mod, please\nvisit our [wiki](https://github.com/AlmostReliable/lootjs/wiki) or explore the [examples](https://github.com/AlmostReliable/lootjs/tree/1.18/examples/server_scripts).\n\n

It brings many new features, and optimizes for the user experience. Outside of the standard Fabric/Quilt API, EMI requires **zero** dependencies, and can be launched with the game simply and easily.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/0d3b5b33d0016b21834ce6f3602169f7c48de13f.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fRiHVvU7/images/f3c8b452eae6dde028c37e3a3e3792459468d865.png)\n\n## Runtime JEI Compat\nFor runtime JEI compat, all you need to do is install JEI alongside EMI and they will work together to share recipes. JEI will be hidden.\n\n## What does EMI bring to the table?\n\nOf course EMI comes with every feature you'd come to expect from the outset, viewing recipes, favoriting items, searching, and the like. But what's new that EMI offers?\n\n* A craftable mode for **quickly crafting** any recipes you're able to make, usable by toggle or as a config for empty searches\n* **Recipes** can be **favorited** with items, and also can be used to quickly craft at a button press\n* A **recipe tree** for breaking down the cost of a complex craft, showing you **every step**, how many **base ingredients** you need, and what you'll have leftover\n* A **recipe tree crafting mode**, counting up the materials and steps you need to be complete to finish a task, including **synthetic favorites** in your sidebar you can use to **craft every step** for exactly as much as you need\n* Smart display of **tags**, with translations, models, and tooltips, showing you ingredients at a glance, such as \"Planks\" instead of slowly rotating through every plank in the game.\n* Smart breakdowns of base costs, letting recipe trees automatically break down to base ingredients, and letting you define **your own defaults** as you play\n* **Tooltips** for recipes, tags, and ingredients showing you what will be crafted, and what makes up an ingredient\n* Binds for quick crafting **straight into your inventory or cursor**, one or many at a time, in conjunction with recipes favorites or the craftable mode\n* A **clean** and **modern** API, built from the ground up to be simple, powerful, and suit all of EMI's features\n* **Zero third party dependencies**. EMI only requires standard, first party Fabric/Quilt APIs\n\n\n## What does EMI stand for?\nIt doesn't, it's not an acronym. Or maybe it's an acronym without a meaning? If it makes you more comfortable, you can pick one from the list below, or make your own up.\n\n* Emi Memy Imi\n* Exhaustively Many Items\n* Explicitly Mandated Items\n* Endless Material Information\n* Expounded Minutia Introspection\n* Earnestly Made Imitation\n* Even More Items\n* Eminence, My Inception\n* Emi's Magic Inventory\n* Efficiently Managed Inventory\n* Exploring Modified: Iridescent\n* Expropriated Matter

Documentation\n-----------------------------------------\n\nModonomicon is an in-game documentation mod inspired by Thaumcraft's Thaumonomicon and Patchouli, and aims to provide the best of both, with some unique flavors.\n\nSome of the most interesting features are:\n\n* Fully data-driven, all books are created via datapack (that means both Modpacks and Mods can add books).\n* Patchouli-like Multiblocks (but fully data driven)\n* Made to be extensible, mods can add new features, such as recipe pages for mod-specific crafting methods.\n* \"Quest/Advancement\"-style 2D view to navigate the content, as seen in the Thaumonomicon.\n* Extensible condition system to unlock entries.\n* Easy styling of content with (extended) Markdown syntax.\n* Various page types to display text, recipes, images, items and more.\n\n### Visit the [Documentation](https://klikli-dev.github.io/modonomicon/) to get started!\n\n### License & Use in Modpacks\n\nModonomicon is licensed under the MIT License

brass you are able to upgrade your copper backtank to a jetpack, \nusing the pressurized air inside to propel yourself through the air.\n\nInspired by [Simply Jetpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-jetpacks-2),\nthis jetpack also has a hover mode.\n\nLike the copper backtank, the jetpack does also go in the chest slot, \nfeeds air to items like the extendo-grip and can be enchanted with _Capacity_.\nJust like the backtank it is charged by placing it down and supplying it with rotational force.\n\n![Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/1.19.x/screenshots/usage.png)\n\nWhen underwater while sprint-swimming, the jetpack boosts your swimming speed.\nAdditionally, the hover-mode prevents you from floating downwards.\n\n![Underwater Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/1.19.x/screenshots/underwater.png)\n\nIf a mod similar to [Elytra Slot](https://github.com/illusivesoulworks/elytraslot), \nwhich enables equipping an elytra in addition to a chestplate, \nthe jetpack will instead give you firework-like boost while the player is pressing the `UP`-key.\n\n![Elytra Support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/1.19.x/screenshots/elytra.png)\n\nCurios Support is possible by adding it via a datapack. Save to following to `data/curios/tags/items/back.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"replace\": false,\n  \"values\": [\n    \"create_jetpack:jetpack\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAn example datapack enabling this support can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/raw/1.20.x/curios_support_datapack.zip).","published":"2022-08-03T19:37:04.967766Z","updated":"2024-03-15T14:24:41.297133Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":301804,"followers":201,"categories":["equipment","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["qK2u15bP","hwCAFm9g","KWGaZitv","VfHJcWCV","ZaO3wBPx","QQsOSo6p","qwqywEp0","JCfa72SK","CagxUkYM","OTlqEW7e","MZ0Fp2vP","Va4f9Ijn","Ca01O4Ic","EUVgMset","BwAfvSSk","8hNOl4lT","wneCxq4p","3Y8uyQl6","Wt1veYzU","m1mDfDyz","4YbEqEXh","Ad6ZRbHF","zWf0XaQE","j4AwCTjn","vzlgZ3TM","B1pQQqpo","orN2NMgR","k1iBfnUj","2Osw0G7B","1rIJmQkh","Y6p7pMUc","E9i2evXM","HD6zEXU2","8Bmf0lk9","1cLd458h","TJ4eIhu1","iDyvo2DK","O7i4rUDB","UdnrG9V2","R7KQG0nR","FHuNKI4B","UVXtwBop","Ic1EDghB","BxQpUvIz","Y4iv8ImO","G5a7PfVo","TftC8J1l","IAaRKHAS","Cg8VpdEO","EGrZabeG","DovFQ1A5","29tj3JjM","9by7IOMl","A0cIeYrd","r9jMwK81","oHclQw2G","IwBgWAGw","CyEc5V7E"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/UbFnAd4l/ead82e9cb62f56962626d1506e5ced3c781df0bf.png"},"version":{"id":"r9jMwK81","project_id":"UbFnAd4l","author_id":"qxswSLtS","featured":false,"name":"Forge 4.2.1","version_number":"4.2.1","changelog":"- elytra boost amount is now configurable","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-27T16:00:38.925220Z","downloads":30882,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c40fcd571b6072d5c0f550c2978e1eca57510ea5","sha512":"a4340c8b2cfb57fa0067f74e8b867b612f45ff479b2ec1b78328febe0c47a1d4c14eb7f26da294ecd2897d63033fe558d31b55e497fcd6954d166f12ee8ba0d5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/UbFnAd4l/versions/r9jMwK81/create_jetpack-forge-4.2.1.jar","filename":"create_jetpack-forge-4.2.1.jar","primary":true,"size":229959,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"LNytGWDc","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"ordsPcFz","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"aEjzU0i9","user":{"id":"qxswSLtS","username":"possible_triangle","name":"Possible Triangle","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12880806?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-06-13T20:35:57.654377Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"create_jetpack-forge-4.2.1.jar"},"mods\\emitrades-forge-1.2.1+mc1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"b0344906a3da867373edf6a4d5a7bcb1d0aa0aaf11825244b9d1d5aeb1aec1c5d023b754ab8f881905c7086ba11d2cdc5740ba29ab967b4549346531bcbc1b86","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"j2HhbEE7","slug":"emitrades","project_type":"mod","team":"ojklZL2q","title":"EMI Trades","description":"Villager trading for EMI.","body":"# EMI Trades\n\nAn addon for EMI adding Villager Trade support.\n\n### Features\n\n* Showing the costs and payments\n* Showing the level required for a trade\n* Wandering trader trade support\n\n### Config\n\nThis mod adds a very simple config in 1.0.2 (`config/emitrades.toml` or `config/emitrades.json5` in 1.2.0+), only to toggle the old and new display of recipes.

Well, wonder no more!\n\nCarry On is a simple mod that improves game interaction by allowing players to pick up, carry, and place single block Tile Entities (such as Chests, Furnaces, Droppers, Spawners, and your favorite machines from other Tech Mods) using only their empty hands. No items (or pickaxes) required. States, meta data, inventory and NBT data are retained. It also allows you to carry around smaller mobs!\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n- Shift (can be rebound) + Right-Click (with Empty Hands) on any Tile Entity or mob to lift and carry\n- Right-Click to place\n\n![Carry On Demo](https://www.creeptech.net/carryon/carryondemo2.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/PJ4Q7tp.gif)\n\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/czlzu1s.gif)\n\n\n**Other features:**\n\n- Works with single block Tile Entities from any mod (yes, tech mods too)\n- Works with all entities (no hostile mobs in survival mode, configurable)\n- Entities can be stacked on each other (only smaller entities on top of larger ones)\n- Respects the ‚Äòlock‚Äô functionality so Tile Entities cannot be stolen\n- Powerful config allows you to blacklist entire mods or specific blocks, and additional customization\n- Players can only carry one Tile Entity or Mob at a time, and are prevented from other actions when carrying\n- Carrying a Tile Entity or Mob slows the player. Items with fuller inventories and larger mobs will cause additional slowness\n- Advanced scripting for modpack creators. Wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Scripting).\n- If you can't place down a picked up block, you can remove it from your inventory with /carryon clear\n- Players can also be carried\n\n**Config Options:**\n\n- Carry On provides a powerful config file, wiki [here](https://github.com/Tschipp/CarryOn/wiki/Model-Override-Config)\n- Specific blocks or entire mods can be blacklisted\n- An option to carry standard blocks (e.g., Dirt) can be enabled (Default = Off)","published":"2022-12-05T21:45:11.691063Z","updated":"2024-02-27T22:40:49.584973Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1069399,"followers":932,"categories":["game-mechanics","storage","transportation"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["WaUwGT7r","aPthYrcV","4taUKxre","ibq5WYnJ","IA7TXsjL","CGK8S9Jc","FS0TPQOn","HMCz7mpi","Tpvzh1n7","CS0T5Zjr","HSrAkWqH","fk6vR3rB","zFYERXVc","F6ZR4jay","QAiSN3Q8","IJ5gr5ow","cE4GdBxS","67jN6bxd","SXmDVLN0","4GE3aVyX","o4LGtvUQ","2jx3bUuL","BycIzhuF","uGbxgawj","LwNYnVxa","NyGIRVfz","1soFLh2H","gq4gg8ZY","fgecxyFN","TNZ4Ah0o","epf47Jaz","f48u7DLZ","i8cp4wxM","u8IQu6NU","TxQzQgUm","tofYc8B0","aKYuUZpd","5QeqM4nf","fg9VeABy","nc5Z9l3C","x5FGVS4q","LTOqV1Cw","iX4EV3eP","9iomDg8D","uemV3oEm","uh2S7w5K","tHTJYcot","e6FYVr4k","6pIQMDen","SgeYUS6n","edGQD16r","Mkla4B3q","AlPBrFTW","CE3MquDi","J7qT9hJD","DjVumdix","EvDx8gEe","8a6KfB5j"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/d07cc032da5a9854489ab5ae443c91c1147792bc.png"},"version":{"id":"edGQD16r","project_id":"joEfVgkn","author_id":"5I09DlLz","featured":false,"name":"Carry On 2.1.2.7","version_number":"2.1.2.7","changelog":"- Fixed Memory Leak\n- Updated default Blacklist\n- Fixed crash with Rats","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-19T22:29:28.090790Z","downloads":198462,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"9999714ca3dd2f2401f0396ca44f3b27c3784c4f","sha512":"4f75afb703dd71c322d4e2e27d28d7ab4afeb0c242bcee6d1eb5fef59ee4347352f1ca55f1826743957d2e95a951ed13884356485b0a979b14010915079e2c29"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/joEfVgkn/versions/edGQD16r/carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","filename":"carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar","primary":true,"size":439457,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4y59IILI","user":{"id":"5I09DlLz","username":"Tschipp","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11649893?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-12-05T21:43:38.882316Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"carryon-forge-1.20.1-2.1.2.7.jar"},"mods\\kjscc-1.0.1-beta.jar":{"sha512":"74789e0876cbe01eb980e68eea67e73bb6add1bf39c0df6a312e3e8229cc542a576a1856b6c6ccf9effb90b4c2d2f6538c6f73903f7bde29c01a65407014e39e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"h43V4ydX","slug":"kubejs+cc-tweaked","project_type":"mod","team":"bcUwwPlT","title":"KubeJS + CC: Tweaked","description":"KubeJS + CC: Tweaked for Forge 1.20.1 and 1.19.2 (fabric soon)","body":"Credits go to Amygdaloideae (Prunoideae on GitHub).

It should generate `kubejs` folder in your minecraft directory with example scripts. startup scripts only get run once when the game loads. Those are for registering items, setting up configs etc. Server/data scripts are loaded when you join a world, those are better for things like clearlag, displaying custom login messages and world/player related things in general.\n\n## Can I reload scripts?\nYes, use `/reload`. Note: Not everything is reloadable. Some things require you to restart game, some only world, some work on fly.\n\n## I don't know JavaScript / I need help with this mod\nThere's examples and pre-made scripts on [KubeJS Wiki](https://kubejs.com/).\n\n## How does this mod work?\nIt uses [Rhino](https://modrinth.com/mod/rhino), a JavaScript engine originally by Mozilla.\n\n## Ok, but what if it.. doesn't work?\nYou can report issues on [Here](https://kubejs.com/support?source=kubejs).\n\n## I have more questions/suggestions!\nIf wiki didn't have the answer for what you were looking for, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/lat) and ask for help in one of the `#support`

This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

Probably. Worth it? Definitely! [Discord](https://discord.gg/VtNrGrs)\n\nHave you ever picked up a magic mod for Minecraft, and thought that it was too tame? Was there not enough danger involved when creating your next high-tech gadget? Bored with all of those peaceful animals just staring at you without a care in the world? Well then, I am glad you came here!  \n  \n\nBlood Magic is an arcane art that is practiced by mages who attempt to gather a vast amount of power through utilizing a forbidden material: blood. Even though it does grant a huge amount of power, every single action that is performed with this volatile magic can prove deadly. You have been warned.  \n  \n\nFor the best experience, you should install [JustEnoughItems](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) to find your way through the recipes.\n\n## Contact\nHave discord? We now have a server if you want to come chat with us! [Here's the link](https://discord.gg/VtNrGrs).\n\n## Getting Started\nGetting started in Blood Magic has changed slightly since 1.7.10. Rather than finding a Diamond to craft a Blood Altar, you need to obtain some Demonic Will. To get your first bit of Will, you'll need to craft some Soul Trumpets Snares and toss them at enemies. If you're lucky, this will snare the enemy. When killed, snared enemies will drop a small amount of their Will. I'll let you take it from there.\n\n## Documentation \nDocumentation is provided via an in-game book managed by [Guide API](https://modrinth.com/mod/guide-api-legacy) under the name \"Sanguine Scientiem\".\n\nIn 1.16.3+, the in-game book is instead managed by [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli)! Can confirm, it's naisu.\n\nIf you're playing in 1.12 and want a web-based guide, see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XLX9VgXOBSRBPyEptMprAJh_SE3W-zvXFGfDu-0m60Q/edit?usp=sharing). Big thanks to Tiyth at MinecraftGuides for putting it together.\n\nThere are web-based mirrors of the Patchouli guide for [1.16](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bOd63XVV79AE4w0Fb1zWWha737cGXbWUFoIHhtu9cw8/edit) and [1.18/1.20](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QfCuNDqDhFuXaDBbuxe9JvgB9XSszkoUvYRPft5jMhU/edit#heading=h.bkcie2978mal) here, respectively. \n\n## Art\nYou may notice the mod has an entirely different look than you may remember. These textures were graciously provided by the [Unity](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/unity) team.\n\n## #Sponsored\nIn the market for a Minecraft server to play with some friends? Don't know how to set one up? Then consider renting an already configured server! \n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/2ad12511-1544-4298-959c-13a840b2653a.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/wayoftime)\n\nIf you click on the picture above and select a plan (recommended 6GB or higher for most modpacks), you can use my code **wayoftime** to get **25%** off of your first month! A small commission of the server goes towards my daily caffeine addiction, but I'd say only consider a purchase if you're already looking for a server!\n\n## Team\n\n#### **WayofTime**\n\nWay works on all the cool content you get to play around with. Can usually be found making a mess for Nut to clean up.\n\n#### **TehNut**\n\nNut is essentially a maid. He primarily works behind the scenes, making sure the codebase itself stays as clean and optimized as it can. He's also in charge of most of the work involved in porting to new Minecraft versions. Can usually be found committing code in the wrong bracing style.\n\n#### **Yulife**\n\nOne of the art people. Currently on an extended vacation.\n\n#### **CyanideX**\n\nAnother art person. Currently on sporadic vacations.\n\n#### **BBoldt**\n\nOur third art person. Currently on a permanent vacation.\n\n#### **VT-14**\n\nOne of the new members of the team.

Config Lib","description":"Config Lib makes dealing with config files just a bit easier.","body":"![SuperMartijn642's Config Lib](https://imgur.com/oVcLlAO.png)   \n**SuperMartijn642's Config Lib** allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only**¬†on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n¬† ¬†ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with¬†`ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10¬†);\n\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n¬† ¬†Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling¬†`ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling¬†`ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and¬†`ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n¬† ¬†builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n¬† ¬†Supplier<Boolean> specialValue =¬†builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n¬† ¬†builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using¬†`ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n¬† ¬†builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values¬†`ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n¬† ¬†builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a concrete example of how to use Config Lib checkout [the example

Gear","description":"Upgradeable tools, weapons, and armor. Completely customizable with data packs!","body":"# Requirements\n\nMinecraft Forge and [Silent Lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/silent-lib) are **required**! Other mods and data packs are optional.\n\n# Introduction\n\nSilent Gear is a mod that focuses on tools, weapon, and armor (collectively called \"gear\".) Gear can be crafted from any material used to make tools and armor in vanilla Minecraft, plus many more. Silent Gear also adds a couple of ores and several new metals that can also be used as gear materials.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Tools, Weapons, and Armor\n\n- **Tools** - Includes pickaxes, shovels, axes, paxels, hoes, mattocks, sickles, prospector hammers (searches for ores), hammers (AOE pickaxe), excavators (AOE shovel), saw (cuts down whole trees).\n- **Weapons** - Includes swords, tridents, machetes, katana, daggers, knives, bow, crossbow, and slingshot\n- **Armor**\n- **Elytra**\n\n### Materials\n\nMaterials are the things used to craft the parts of gear (tools, weapons, and armor.)\n\n- Basic \"vanilla\" materials include wood, stone, flint, netherrack, copper, iron, gold, diamond, emerald, obsidian, netherite, and more.\n- A few unique Silent Gear materials including crimson steel, azure electrum, and tyrian steel.\n- Metals commonly added by mods such as tin, silver, lead, and many more are supported. The items required to use these materials are _not_ added by Silent Gear.\n\n# Crafting Gear\n\nAlmost all recipes are shapeless and can be made in any vanilla crafting grid. **Check JEI if you are unsure of a recipe!**\n\nBlueprints and templates are essential for crafting any gear item. A blueprint can be reused infinitely. A template is consumed with one use. They are identical otherwise.\n\n_Every item requires a **main part**. Tools and weapons requires a **rod** and some require a **cord**._\n\n## Tools and Melee Weapons\n\nCombine the blueprint (or template) for the tool with the correct number of materials to make the **main part** (tool head, blade, etc.) The materials must all be the same, but may have different grades or other modifiers. Then craft the main part with a **rod**. You can craft a rod using a rod blueprint, or just use a plain ol' stick if you have nothing else.\n\n![Blueprint to head to tool with rod (shapeless)](https://imgur.com/Vvvafsy.png)\n\nOr just use the quick recipe (available for most tools)\n\n![Quick craft of a pickaxe](https://imgur.com/4HAzQ7C.png)\n\n## Ranged Weapons and Fishing Rods\n\nRanged weapons such as bows and crossbows, as well as fishing rods, require a **cord** part in addition to a main part and a rod. The crafting process is identical, except that you must add both the cord and the rod at the same time.\n\n![Quick craft of a bow](https://imgur.com/tYEqvd6.png)\n\n## Armor\n\nArmor requires only a main part, called **plates**. There is no quick crafting recipe. Craft the armor plates first, then craft the plates into armor. You can optionally add a **lining** part during crafting.\n\n![Making armor plates](https://imgur.com/fsgv0wl.png)![Armor plates plus lining to make armor](https://imgur.com/YZtn49T.png)\n\n## Elytra\n\nElytra require both **wings** (the main part) and a **binding** part to craft. The wings are non-functional by themselves and must be crafted with a binding. The wings may only be crafted with materials in the \"cloth\" and \"sheet\" categories, which includes **sheet metal** made in the metal press.\n\n![Crafting elytra wings](https://imgur.com/4Tgf4vq.png)![Crafting a finished elytra with wings and binding](https://imgur.com/ZUzR2zT.png)\n\n## Curios\n\nCurios (such as rings and bracelets) are a little different. They still require a blueprint for the main part, but also require **jeweler's tools** during the crafting process.\n\nFirst, make the main part with the blueprint. Unlike most items, this will _only accept metal materials_ (determined by material category). Second, use the jeweler's tools to craft an adornment. Finally, use the jeweler's tools to combine the parts into a finished curio item.\n\n![Crafting a ring shank](https://imgur.com/x1Z2ZuL.png)![Crafting an adornment](https://imgur.com/inAAfnE.png)![Crafting a ring with adornment](https://imgur.com/E69fDZ8.png)\n\n## Vanilla Conversion\n\nMost vanilla items can be converted into a Silent Gear equivalent by simply placing it into a crafting grid by itself.\n\n![](https://imgur.com/5LStiJx.png)\n\n## Grades and the Material Grader\n\nGrades are material modifiers which apply an additional multiplier on some, but not all stats. Possible grades are, from lowest to highest: E, D, C, B, A, S, SS, SSS, and MAX. Materials can be graded in the **material grader** block. The grader requires catalysts to function, and consumes one catalyst per grading attempt. Grades are assigned randomly, based on a normal distribution.\n\n![The material grader](https://imgur.com/owiVyfN.png)\n\n### Catalysts\n\nCatalysts are consumed when grading. The average grade depends on the tier of the catalyst, meaning that higher tier catalysts are more likely to give better grades.\n\nThere are five possible catalyst tiers, defined by item tags, but only three have items in them by default. The default catalysts are:\n\n- Glowing dust (tier 1)\n- Blazing dust (tier 2)\n- Glittery dust (tier 3)\n\n### Re-grading\n\nMaterials that are already graded can be placed back into the grader to re-grade them. If the material grader rolls a higher grader, the material gets the new grade. If it rolls the same grade or lower, nothing changes but catalyst is still consumed.\n\n## Compound Making (Alloys)\n\nCertain blocks can be used to craft compound material items (often called \"alloys\" by the community!) These blocks include the metal alloyer, recrystallizer, and refabricator. These blocks are more mid/late game, so don't expect to be able to craft them right away. They can combine up to four materials into a single compound. Place two or more unique, simple (not compound) materials into the input slots, then toggle the \"Work\" button when you are happy with the result preview.\n\n# Repairing\n\nThere are a couple of ways to repair gear, outlined below. Note that you _cannot_ simply craft two similar gear items together to repair them.\n\n## Repair Kits (Quick Repairs)\n\nRepair kits allow gear items to be quickly repaired in any crafting grid. The repair kit can either be filled with materials ahead of time, or place the gear item, repair kit, and materials into any crafting grid. But the tier of the material must be the same or higher than that of the gear's primary part. No repairing your emerald pickaxe with cobblestone, that would be silly!\n\nThere are several tiers of repair kits. Each has a different capacity and efficiency modifier. Higher efficiency means you get more out of the materials used during repairs. Both values can be controlled in the config file.\n\n![Filling a repair kit](https://imgur.com/5p8HpwR.png)![Using a filled repair kit to repair a tool](https://imgur.com/lj3xCsP.png)\n\n## Anvil Repairs\n\nAnvils can be used to repair gear. You may get more out of the materials used for the repair, but it will also cost XP levels.\n\n# Upgrade Parts\n\nSome parts serve as upgrades for existing gear items. Some can be applied in any crafting grid, while others require a smithing table. Note that items can only have one upgrade of each type. Trying to add a new tip upgrade to an item that already has one will replace the existing upgrade, and possibly return the old one to you.\n\n## Tip Upgrades\n\nTip upgrades apply stat bonuses and often useful traits to tools.\n\n## Coatings\n\nCoatings are upgrades which usually apply substantial stat bonuses. They can only be applied in a smithing table. The number of materials which can be used as coatings is very limited, and includes gold and netherite.\n\n## Bindings and Grips\n\nThese are more minor upgrades which usually apply small stat bonuses (if any) and durability-improving traits.\n\n## Miscellaneous Upgrades\n\n- Red Card - Allows the item to break permanently, regardless of config settings.\n- Spoon - Allows pickaxes (and only pickaxes) to mine anything a shovel can.\n\n# World Generation\n\nSilent Gear adds a few new things to the world, although it tries to be as unobtrusive as possible, keeping new ores and such to a minimum. These are some things you may find in the world, where to find them, and what you can do with them.\n\n_Note the new ores are named for the color of their alloy, rather than the base metal._\n\n## Wild Flax\n\nWild flax plants can be found in some biomes, usually mountainous and plains-like biomes. Breaking wild plants will yield seeds, but not fibers or flowers. The seeds will grow normal flax plants which drop fibers, flowers, and seeds.\n\n## Wild Fluffy Plants\n\nWild fluffy plants are found in less dry biomes, such as forests. Breaking wild plants will yield only seeds. The seeds will grow normal fluffy plants which will drop fluffy puffs and seed.\n\n## Bort\n\nBort ore can be found deep underground in single blocks, not clusters. Mining yields one bort, or more with Fortune. Bort is required to craft **adornments**.\n\n## Crimson Iron\n\nCrimson iron ore can be found in all Nether biomes at most heights. Mining requires a pickaxe with a harvest level of 2 or higher (iron, etc.) Smelting raw crimson iron will yield crimson iron ingots, which can be used to make **crimson steel** (please use JEI to check recipes).\n\n## Azure Silver\n\nAzure silver ore can be found in the End at most heights. Mining requires a pickaxe with a harvest level of 4 (crimson steel, netherite-coated, etc.) Smelting raw azure silver yields azure silver ingots, which can be used to make **azure electrum** (use JEI for recipes).\n\n## Netherwood\n\nNetherwood saplings can be found in certain loot chests, mostly in the Nether. All Netherwood blocks (planks, etc.) are fire-proof. The leaves will drop saplings, netherwood sticks, and nether bananas. Smelting a log yields netherwood charcoal, instead of vanilla charcoal.","published":"2023-06-09T13:15:07.390398Z","updated":"2024-06-25T02:06:16.025919Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":18776,"followers":42,"categories":["equipment"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["forge","neoforge"],"versions":["I444dSdt","FKArUzOk","oSiKZEgb","MacSMl0V","2cKKuqNq","A9Eik4Ie","rJt930YF","RPfIJYsS","7KW59Orf","uaHFpxje","jGMP2YJZ","4T9KJGkB","ezjY1zWy","UG6qDhny","Z6h0bZ2L","6HCIvZLn","16yrkiNN","OOePgqOp","R6vj2LNz","VA6DRIpe","mfRIOnOu","dUCl8ryo","AMiX2QG4","o92MYe1M","cSZan7sC"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/73mSSnCf/206ca5fd84455ca3a12987599425c8ede2b842a9.png"},"version":{"id":"cSZan7sC","project_id":"73mSSnCf","author_id":"JOAkV1iW","featured":false,"name":"Silent Gear 3.6.5","version_number":"3.6.5","changelog":"## [1.20.1-3.6.5] - 2024-06-24\n### Fixed\n- ConcurrentModificationException in PartType item cache","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-25T02:06:16.945926Z","downloads":672,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"446ad0b8e1185526e587e4c0bc73435c461c7b3c","sha512":"010b50a930d91adbb054baa2e75eed17560bc4319b3bc11afb7e04ee790a702a4c91826ebfb7d029d1cd6a15195bbb19a15e26cdbf14627ce02fc83e2ff8c7f0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/73mSSnCf/versions/cSZan7sC/silent-gear-1.20.1-3.6.5.jar","filename":"silent-gear-1.20.1-3.6.5.jar","primary":true,"size":2734414,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"BQhuHQo4","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["forge"]},"members":[{"team_id":"6qvMPHhb","user":{"id":"JOAkV1iW","username":"SilentChaos512","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5721949?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-06-08T01:03:28.473468Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"silent-gear-1.20.1-3.6.5.jar"},"mods\\waystones-forge-1.20-14.1.4.jar":{"sha512":"56b276e12145740ef7a59f5429cd9bead3c385c63f03450b539bde3b4b1b4ffbdd8054dd20f4bdc5e8790352bd53de5aef688357d182683a89f2b8b589c0d94c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"LOpKHB2A","slug":"waystones","project_type":"mod","team":"cPt0ZaJz","title":"Waystones","description":"Teleport back to activated waystones.
